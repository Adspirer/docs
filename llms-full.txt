## Campaign Types

### Google Search Campaigns

Text ads that appear when people search specific keywords on Google. Best for capturing high-intent traffic -- people actively looking for your product or service.

**When to use:** Lead generation, e-commerce, local services, SaaS signups.

### Performance Max (PMax) Campaigns

AI-powered campaigns that show ads across all Google channels: Search, Display, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, and Discover. Google's algorithm automatically optimizes placement and creative combinations.

**When to use:** E-commerce (especially with product feeds), broad awareness + conversions, when you have strong creative assets (images + video).

## Search Campaign Creation Workflow

Google Search campaigns follow a 5-step workflow. Skip steps and the campaign will fail validation.

```
1. get_connections_status
   -> (verify Google Ads is connected)
2. research_keywords
   -> (input: business description, seed keywords, target location)
   -> (output: keyword suggestions with real CPC data)
3. discover_existing_assets
   -> (check if you have headlines/descriptions in Google Ads already)
4. suggest_ad_content (if new assets needed)
   -> (generate headlines and descriptions within Google's character limits)
5. validate_and_prepare_assets
   -> (verify everything meets Google's requirements)
6. create_search_campaign
   -> (campaign created PAUSED -- you review before launching)
```

## PMax Campaign Creation Workflow

Performance Max requires more creative assets than Search. Four-step workflow:

```
1. get_connections_status
   -> (verify Google Ads is connected)
2. discover_existing_assets
   -> (check for images, videos, logos in your account)
3. help_user_upload (if assets are missing)
   -> (guide you to upload to Google or provide URLs)
4. validate_and_prepare_assets
   -> (PMax requires: 5+ images, 1+ video, 5+ headlines, 5+ descriptions)
5. create_pmax_campaign
   -> (campaign created PAUSED)
```

### PMax Asset Requirements

* **Images:** Minimum 5 (1200x628px landscape + 1200x1200px square)
* **Video:** Minimum 1 (under 30 seconds recommended)
* **Headlines:** 5 (max 30 characters each)
* **Descriptions:** 5 (max 90 characters each)
* **Logo:** 1 (1200x1200px)

## Example Prompts

### Analyze Performance

```
Pull my Google Ads performance for the last 30 days.
Show spend, conversions, CPA, and ROAS.
Highlight any campaigns with ROAS below 2.0.
```

### Research Keywords

```
Research keywords for emergency plumbing services in Chicago.
Show me search volume, CPC estimates, and competition level.
Suggest which keywords to target and which to avoid.
```

### Find Wasted Spend

```
Analyze my Google Ads for wasted spend.
Find keywords that have spent more than $50 but generated zero conversions.
Recommend which to pause and which to add as negative keywords.
```

### Create a Search Campaign

```
Create a Google Search campaign:
- Business: Online pet supply store
- Target keywords: organic dog food, natural dog treats, premium pet food
- Location: United States
- Budget: $40/day
- Objective: Website conversions (purchases)

Research the keywords first, generate ad copy, then build the campaign.
```

### Create a Performance Max Campaign

```
Create a Performance Max campaign for luxury watches:
- Budget: $50/day
- Target audience: Men 25-54 interested in fashion and luxury goods
- Creative: [provide image and video URLs]
- Objective: Online sales

Validate all assets meet PMax requirements first.
```

### Optimize Budget

```
Analyze my Google Ads campaigns for the last 30 days.
Which campaigns have the best ROAS?
Recommend how to reallocate my $3,000/month budget to maximize conversions.
```

## Keyword Research: What You Need to Know

The `research_keywords` tool connects directly to Google Keyword Planner data. You get:

* **Search volume:** Monthly search estimates for each keyword
* **CPC data:** Average cost-per-click and estimated bid range
* **Competition level:** Low, Medium, or High
* **Keyword suggestions:** Related keywords you may not have considered

<Warning>
  Keyword research is a Read tool (no cost impact), but always review the data before committing budget. High-volume keywords are not always the best choice -- look for keywords with good volume AND manageable CPC relative to your target CPA.
</Warning>

## Ad Copy Guidelines

The `suggest_ad_content` tool generates headlines and descriptions within Google's strict character limits:

* **Headlines:** Up to 15 headlines, max 30 characters each
* **Descriptions:** Up to 4 descriptions, max 90 characters each
* **Display URL paths:** 2 paths, max 15 characters each

Google dynamically combines your headlines and descriptions. Provide diverse options so Google's algorithm can find high-performing combinations.

## Budget Guidelines

* **Minimum:** \$10/day per campaign (Google's practical minimum for Search)
* **Recommended:** \$30+/day for meaningful data collection
* **Testing:** Start with \$40/day split across 3-5 ad groups to test different keyword themes
* **Scaling:** Once you find keywords with CPA below target, increase budget 20-30% every 5-7 days
* **PMax minimum:** \$20+/day recommended (PMax needs budget to test across multiple channels)

## Best Use Cases for Google Ads

* **Demand capture:** Reach people actively searching for your product or service (highest intent of any platform)
* **Local services:** Plumbers, dentists, lawyers, restaurants -- people searching "near me"
* **E-commerce:** Product searches, comparison shopping, brand searches
* **SaaS & B2B:** High-intent keywords like "CRM software" or "marketing automation tool"
* **Lead generation:** Contact forms, phone calls, demo requests from search traffic

**Not ideal for:** Brand awareness (use [Meta Ads](/ad-platforms/meta-ads) or [TikTok Ads](/ad-platforms/tiktok-ads) instead), visual/video-first products, targeting by job title (use [LinkedIn Ads](/ad-platforms/linkedin-ads)).

## Troubleshooting

### "Ad account not connected" error

Re-authenticate your Google Ads account:

```
Connect my Google Ads account
```

Make sure you select the correct Google account and ad account during OAuth. If you manage multiple accounts (MCC), you may need to specify which sub-account to use.

### "Asset validation failed" error

Common causes:

* Headlines exceed 30 characters or descriptions exceed 90 characters
* Fewer than 5 images for PMax campaigns
* Image dimensions do not meet minimum requirements
* Missing required asset types (PMax needs images, headlines, descriptions, and at least one logo)

Run validation separately to diagnose:

```
Validate my Google Ads assets for a Search campaign
```

### "Campaign creation failed" error

Most common reason: skipping workflow steps. Google campaigns require keyword research and asset validation before creation. If you jump straight to `create_search_campaign` without running `research_keywords` and `validate_and_prepare_assets` first, it will fail.

If you're using [agent skills](/agent-skills/overview), the AI enforces the correct workflow automatically.

### "Keyword research returned no results"

This usually means your seed keywords or business description is too narrow. Try:

* Broader seed keywords (e.g., "plumber" instead of "emergency residential copper pipe repair")
* Different location targeting (e.g., expand from city to state)
* More descriptive business description so the tool can suggest related terms

### High CPA with no conversions

Common issue with new campaigns. Troubleshoot:

* Review search terms with `analyze_search_terms` -- are irrelevant queries consuming budget?
* Add negative keywords with `add_negative_keywords` to block wasteful clicks
* Check landing page quality -- Google Ads can drive clicks but conversions depend on your website
* Use `analyze_wasted_spend` to identify keywords spending without converting

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Search and Performance Max campaigns?">
    **Search campaigns** show text ads on Google Search results when people search specific keywords. You control which keywords trigger your ads. Best for high-intent traffic.

    **Performance Max campaigns** use Google's AI to show ads across all Google channels (Search, Display, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Discover). You provide creative assets and a conversion goal, and Google optimizes everything automatically. Best when you have strong creative assets and want broad reach with automated optimization.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Adspirer generate images or videos for Google Ads?">
    No. Adspirer generates ad copy (headlines and descriptions) through the `suggest_ad_content` tool, but it does not create images or videos. For PMax campaigns, you provide image/video URLs from Google Drive, Dropbox, S3, or any public URL. The `validate_and_prepare_assets` tool ensures your assets meet Google's specifications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I manage Google Ads and Meta Ads from the same conversation?">
    Yes. Adspirer supports multi-platform management. You can pull Google Ads performance, then switch to Meta Ads analysis in the same conversation. Use `get_connections_status` to see all connected platforms.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Google Ads and Meta Ads?">
    **[Google Ads](/ad-platforms/google-ads):** Best for demand capture (reaching people actively searching for solutions). Keyword-based targeting. Higher intent but more expensive clicks.

    **[Meta Ads](/ad-platforms/meta-ads):** Best for demand generation (reaching people who don't know you exist) and visual products. Interest-based targeting. Lower intent but cheaper clicks.

    Most advertisers run both: Google for high-intent searches, Meta for awareness and retargeting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does Adspirer cost for Google Ads?">
    Adspirer pricing is based on tool calls, not ad spend. Free tier: 10 calls/month. Plus: $25/mo for 50 calls. Pro: $75/mo for 100 calls. A typical Google Search campaign creation uses 5-6 tool calls. Keyword research alone is 1 call. See [full pricing](https://www.adspirer.com/pricing).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my Google Ads data secure?">
    Yes. Adspirer uses OAuth 2.1 authentication -- your Google Ads credentials are never stored on Adspirer's servers. All connections are HTTPS-encrypted with least-privilege access scopes. You can revoke access at any time from your Google account settings.

## B2B Targeting Options

LinkedIn's targeting is the most precise for B2B. Here's what you can target:

### Job Criteria

* **Job titles:** CMO, VP Marketing, Marketing Manager, Growth Lead, etc.
* **Job functions:** Marketing, Sales, Engineering, Operations, etc.
* **Seniority:** C-level, VP, Director, Manager, Entry-level
* **Years of experience:** 0-2, 3-5, 6-10, 11+ years

### Company Criteria

* **Industries:** Computer Software, Financial Services, Marketing & Advertising, etc. (140+ options)
* **Company size:** 1-10, 11-50, 51-200, 201-500, 501-1000, 1001-5000, 5001-10000, 10001+ employees
* **Company name:** Target specific companies (ABM campaigns)
* **Company growth rate:** Fast-growing companies (20%+ headcount growth)

### Skills & Interests

* **Skills:** SaaS, Marketing Automation, SEO, Content Marketing, etc.
* **Groups:** Target members of specific LinkedIn groups
* **Interests:** Categories professionals engage with

## Budget Guidelines

* **Minimum:** \$10/day (LinkedIn's requirement)
* **Recommended:** \$50+/day for meaningful B2B lead volume
* **Testing:** Start with \$75/day split across 2-3 audience segments
* **CPC range:** Expect \$8-15+ per click (higher than Meta/Google but higher quality leads)
* **Cost per lead:** B2B leads typically \$40-150 depending on industry and targeting

## Creative Requirements

LinkedIn sponsored content uses single images. The `validate_and_prepare_linkedin_assets` tool checks:

* **Dimensions:** 1200x627px (1.91:1 aspect ratio) or 1200x1200px (1:1)
* **Format:** JPG or PNG
* **File size:** Under 5MB
* **Text:** Intro text up to 600 characters (150 shown before "see more")
* **Headline:** Up to 200 characters
* **Call-to-action:** Learn More, Download, Sign Up, Register, Apply, etc.

## Best Use Cases for LinkedIn Ads

* **B2B lead generation:** Demos, webinar signups, whitepaper downloads
* **Account-based marketing (ABM):** Target specific companies or job titles
* **Thought leadership:** Content promotion to build brand authority
* **Event promotion:** Conferences, trade shows, virtual events
* **Recruitment:** Job postings to specific professional audiences

**Not ideal for:** E-commerce, consumer products, impulse purchases. LinkedIn is a B2B platform. CPC is high, but lead quality is excellent for long sales cycles.

## Troubleshooting

### "No organizations found" error

You need a LinkedIn company page before you can run ads. Create one at [linkedin.com/company/setup/new](https://www.linkedin.com/company/setup/new), then reconnect your LinkedIn Ads account in Adspirer.

### "Campaign creation failed" error

Most common reason: skipping `get_linkedin_organizations`. You must select an organization before creating campaigns. Run the full workflow in order.

If you're using [agent skills](/agent-skills/overview), the AI enforces the correct workflow automatically.

### "Audience too small" warning

LinkedIn requires a minimum audience size of 300 members. If your targeting is too narrow (e.g., "CMOs at Series A SaaS startups in San Francisco"), broaden it:

* Expand job titles (CMO, VP Marketing, Head of Marketing)
* Widen geography (San Francisco -> Bay Area -> California)
* Increase company size range (Series A -> Series A-C)

### High CPC but low conversions

Common issue with LinkedIn. Your targeting might be too broad. Tighten it:

* Add seniority filters (target decision-makers, not individual contributors)
* Use negative targeting (exclude students, job seekers)
* Test different creative (professional, data-driven imagery works best on LinkedIn)
* Optimize your landing page for B2B (short forms, clear value prop, no fluff)

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I run video ads on LinkedIn through Adspirer?">
    Not yet. Adspirer currently supports image-based sponsored content only. Video ad support is on the roadmap for Q2 2026.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I target by company revenue?">
    LinkedIn doesn't expose revenue as a targeting option via the API. You can target by company size (employee count) and industry as a proxy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between LinkedIn and Google Ads for B2B?">
    **LinkedIn:** Best for demand generation (reaching people who might need your solution but aren't actively searching). Target by job title/seniority. Higher CPC but better B2B lead quality.

    **[Google Ads](/ad-platforms/google-ads):** Best for demand capture (reaching people actively searching for solutions like yours). Target by keywords. Lower CPC but broader intent.

    Most B2B companies run both: Google for high-intent keywords, LinkedIn for cold outreach to specific job titles.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use LinkedIn's Matched Audiences (retargeting)?">
    Not through Adspirer yet. Matched Audiences (website retargeting, contact list uploads) requires additional API permissions that are in development. For now, focus on interest-based and job title targeting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does Adspirer cost for LinkedIn Ads?">
    Adspirer pricing is based on tool calls, not ad spend. Free tier: 10 calls/month. Plus: $25/mo for 50 calls. Pro: $75/mo for 100 calls. A typical LinkedIn campaign creation uses 5-6 tool calls. See [full pricing](https://www.adspirer.com/pricing).

* **Lead generation:** On-platform forms (though LinkedIn often performs better for B2B)

## Troubleshooting

### "Ad account not connected" error

Re-authenticate your Meta Business Manager:

```
Connect my Meta Ads account
```

Make sure you select the correct ad account during OAuth. If you manage multiple accounts, you may need to reconnect with admin permissions.

### "Asset validation failed" error

Common causes:

* Image/video URL is private (not publicly accessible)
* Wrong dimensions (Meta requires minimum 1080x1080px)
* File too large (30MB for images, 4GB for video)
* Unsupported format (use JPG/PNG for images, MP4/MOV for video)

Run validation separately to diagnose:

```
Validate this Meta creative: [your URL]
```

### "Campaign creation failed" error

Most common reason: skipping workflow steps. Meta campaigns require all 6 steps in order. If you jump straight to `create_meta_image_campaign` without running `validate_and_prepare_meta_assets` first, it will fail.

If you're using [agent skills](/agent-skills/overview), the AI enforces the correct workflow automatically.

### Creative fatigue detection not working

The tool needs at least 14 days of data per ad. If your ads are newer, it can't detect fatigue yet. Wait until ads have run for 2+ weeks.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I manage Instagram ads separately from Facebook?">
    No. Meta treats Facebook and Instagram as placement options within the same campaign. When you create a Meta campaign through Adspirer, you choose placements (Feed, Stories, Reels, etc.) that span both platforms. You can't create Instagram-only campaigns through the API.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Adspirer generate ad creatives?">
    No. Adspirer manages campaigns, not creative production. You provide image/video URLs. For AI-generated creatives, use tools like Midjourney, DALL-E, or Runway, then upload to Google Drive/Dropbox and provide the link.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I A/B test creatives?">
    Yes. Create multiple ad sets with different creatives (different image URLs) but the same targeting and budget. After 7 days, use `analyze_meta_ad_performance` to see which creative wins, then pause the losers and scale the winner.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Meta and Google Ads?">
    **Meta Ads:** Best for demand generation (reaching people who don't know you exist) and visual products. Interest-based targeting. Lower intent but cheaper clicks.

    **[Google Ads](/ad-platforms/google-ads):** Best for demand capture (reaching people actively searching for solutions). Keyword-based targeting. Higher intent but more expensive clicks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does Adspirer cost for Meta Ads?">
    Adspirer pricing is based on tool calls, not ad spend. Free tier: 10 calls/month. Plus: $25/mo for 50 calls. Pro: $75/mo for 100 calls. A typical Meta campaign creation uses 4-6 tool calls. See [full pricing](https://www.adspirer.com/pricing).

# TikTok Ads Integration Guide
Source: https://www.adspirer.com/docs/ad-platforms/tiktok-ads

Create and manage TikTok In-Feed video campaigns with AI. 4 tools for video asset management, campaign creation, and performance tracking.

# TikTok Ads Integration

Reach TikTok's billion-plus users with AI-powered campaign management. Create In-Feed video ads, validate creative assets, and track performance with 4 specialized tools.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
  * TikTok Ads Manager account ([create one here](https://ads.tiktok.com))
  * A TikTok Business Center account with billing enabled
  * Admin access to the ad account you want to manage
  * Adspirer account connected via [Claude Code](/ai-clients/claude-code), [Cursor](/ai-clients/cursor), or any [supported AI client](https://www.adspirer.com/integrations)
</Note>

## Connecting TikTok Ads

Once you've set up Adspirer with your AI client, connect TikTok:

1. Open your AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Claude Code, etc.)
2. Say: "Connect my TikTok Ads account"
3. Adspirer opens your browser for OAuth authorization
4. Sign in to TikTok Business Center and select the ad account you want to manage
5. Approve permissions (read campaign data, create ads, manage budgets)

Verify the connection:

```
Check my connected ad platforms
```

You should see your TikTok ad account listed with advertiser name, account ID, and active status.

## What You Can Do (4 Tools)

### Performance Analysis

* `get_tiktok_campaign_performance` -- Pull metrics for TikTok campaigns (video views, engagement, conversions, cost metrics)

### Creative Management

* `discover_tiktok_assets` -- Check existing video creatives in your TikTok account
* `validate_and_prepare_tiktok_assets` -- Verify video files meet TikTok's requirements (9:16 vertical, 5-60 seconds, MP4/MOV)

### Campaign Creation

* `create_tiktok_campaign` -- Launch In-Feed video campaigns (created PAUSED)

<Tip>
  TikTok Ads is Adspirer's newest integration with a focused tool set. Additional tools for audience targeting, budget optimization, and ad group management are on the roadmap. The current 4 tools cover the core workflow: check assets, validate creatives, create campaigns, and track performance.
</Tip>

## Campaign Creation Workflow

TikTok campaigns follow a streamlined 4-step workflow:

```
1. get_connections_status
   -> (verify TikTok Ads is connected)
2. discover_tiktok_assets
   -> (check existing videos in your account)
3. validate_and_prepare_tiktok_assets
   -> (verify video meets TikTok requirements: 9:16 vertical, 5-60 seconds)
4. create_tiktok_campaign
   -> (campaign created PAUSED -- you review before launching)
```

## Example Prompts

### Check Performance

```
Pull my TikTok Ads performance for the last 14 days.
Show video views, engagement rate, conversions, and cost per conversion.
Which campaigns have the best video completion rate?
```

### Create a Campaign

```
Create a TikTok campaign:
- Product: Skincare brand targeting women 18-34
- Audience: Women interested in beauty, skincare, wellness
- Budget: $50/day
- Creative: [provide video URL]
- Objective: Website conversions

Validate the video first, then build the campaign.
```

### Upload and Validate Video

```
Validate this TikTok video creative: [your video URL]
Check if it meets TikTok's specs for In-Feed ads.
```

### Analyze What's Working

```
Show me my TikTok campaign performance for the last 30 days.
Which ad creatives have the highest engagement rate?
What's my average cost per conversion across all campaigns?
```

## Creative Assets: What You Need to Know

TikTok is a video-first platform. All campaigns require video creative.

<Warning>
  Adspirer does NOT generate videos. You provide video URLs from Google Drive, Dropbox, S3, or any publicly accessible link. The `validate_and_prepare_tiktok_assets` tool checks that your video meets TikTok's specifications before campaign creation.
</Warning>

### TikTok's Creative Requirements

The `validate_and_prepare_tiktok_assets` tool checks these automatically:

* **Aspect ratio:** 9:16 (vertical) -- 1080x1920px recommended
* **Duration:** 5-60 seconds (9-15 seconds performs best for engagement)
* **Format:** MP4 or MOV
* **File size:** Under 500MB
* **Resolution:** Minimum 720p (1280x720px), 1080p recommended

### Supported Asset Sources

* Google Drive (public or shared links)
* Dropbox (public links)
* Amazon S3 (public URLs)
* Any publicly accessible video URL

### Creative Best Practices

* **Hook in the first 2 seconds:** TikTok users scroll fast. Grab attention immediately.
* **Native look and feel:** Ads that look like organic TikTok content outperform polished commercials
* **Vertical video only:** Horizontal or square videos perform significantly worse on TikTok
* **Sound on:** Unlike other platforms, most TikTok users watch with sound on. Use music and voiceover.
* **Short and punchy:** 9-15 seconds is the sweet spot for In-Feed ads

## Ad Format: In-Feed Ads

TikTok In-Feed ads appear in users' For You feed and blend with organic content. They support:

* **Traffic objective:** Drive users to your website or landing page
* **Conversions objective:** Optimize for specific actions (purchases, signups, add to cart)
* **App installs:** Drive mobile app downloads

In-Feed ads auto-play with sound as users scroll through their feed. Users can like, comment, share, and follow directly from the ad.

## Targeting Options

When creating TikTok campaigns through Adspirer, you can target by:

### Demographics

* **Age:** 13-17, 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55+
* **Gender:** Male, Female, All
* **Location:** Country, state/region, city-level targeting

### Interests & Behaviors

* **Interests:** Beauty, Fashion, Food & Beverage, Technology, Fitness, Gaming, and 20+ categories
* **Behavioral signals:** Video interaction patterns, content engagement history
* **Device:** iOS, Android, specific device models

## Budget Guidelines

* **Minimum:** \$20/day per campaign (TikTok's requirement for campaign-level budgets)
* **Ad group minimum:** \$20/day
* **Recommended:** \$50+/day for meaningful data collection
* **Testing:** Start with \$50/day on a single ad group to gauge performance before scaling
* **CPC range:** Expect \$0.50-2.00 per click (varies by industry and targeting)
* **CPM range:** \$6-10 per thousand impressions

## Best Use Cases for TikTok Ads

* **E-commerce:** Products that photograph/film well (fashion, beauty, gadgets, food)
* **Brand awareness:** Reaching younger demographics (Gen Z and Millennials) at scale
* **Product launches:** New product reveals with authentic, native-feeling video content
* **App installs:** Mobile-first audience with high app download intent
* **Direct-to-consumer brands:** Brands that can create authentic, engaging short-form video

**Not ideal for:** B2B lead generation (use [LinkedIn Ads](/ad-platforms/linkedin-ads)), high-intent search capture (use [Google Ads](/ad-platforms/google-ads)), audiences over 45 (limited reach on TikTok).

## Troubleshooting

### "Ad account not connected" error

Re-authenticate your TikTok Business Center account:

```
Connect my TikTok Ads account
```

Make sure you select the correct advertiser account during OAuth. If you manage multiple accounts in TikTok Business Center, you may need to reconnect and select the right one.

### "Asset validation failed" error

Common causes:

* Video is not in 9:16 vertical format (horizontal or square videos are rejected)
* Video duration is outside 5-60 second range
* File too large (over 500MB)
* Unsupported format (use MP4 or MOV)
* Video URL is private or not publicly accessible

Run validation separately to diagnose:

```
Validate this TikTok video creative: [your URL]
```

### "Campaign creation failed" error

Most common reason: skipping the asset validation step. TikTok campaigns require `validate_and_prepare_tiktok_assets` before `create_tiktok_campaign`. The validation tool uploads and processes the video in TikTok's system.

If you're using [agent skills](/agent-skills/overview), the AI enforces the correct workflow automatically.

### Low video completion rates

Your creative may not be engaging enough for TikTok's audience. Common fixes:

* Stronger hook in the first 2 seconds
* Use trending sounds or music
* Make it feel organic, not like a traditional ad
* Shorter duration (try 9-12 seconds instead of 30+)
* Test multiple video variations to find what resonates

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I create image ads on TikTok through Adspirer?">
    Not currently. TikTok is a video-first platform, and Adspirer supports In-Feed video ads. While TikTok does support some image-based formats (like Spark Ads), the current integration focuses on video campaigns. Image ad support may be added in the future based on TikTok's API capabilities.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Adspirer generate TikTok video content?">
    No. Adspirer manages campaigns, not video production. You create videos using your preferred tools (CapCut, Canva, Adobe Premiere, or even your phone) and provide the video URL. For AI-generated video, tools like Runway, Pika, or HeyGen can help. Upload the result to Google Drive or Dropbox and provide the link to Adspirer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between TikTok Ads and Meta Ads?">
    **TikTok Ads:** Video-first platform with a younger audience (Gen Z, Millennials). Content feels native and authentic. Strong for brand discovery and impulse purchases. Lower CPM but requires video creative.

    **[Meta Ads](/ad-platforms/meta-ads):** Supports image, video, and carousel formats. Broader age demographics. More advanced targeting and retargeting options. Better for retargeting and full-funnel campaigns.

    Many advertisers run both: TikTok for awareness and discovery, Meta for retargeting and conversion optimization.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I boost existing TikTok organic posts?">
    Not through Adspirer currently. Boosting organic posts (Spark Ads) requires additional API permissions. The current integration creates new In-Feed ads with your uploaded video creatives. Spark Ads support is being evaluated for a future release.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does Adspirer cost for TikTok Ads?">
    Adspirer pricing is based on tool calls, not ad spend. Free tier: 10 calls/month. Plus: $25/mo for 50 calls. Pro: $75/mo for 100 calls. A typical TikTok campaign creation uses 3-4 tool calls. See [full pricing](https://www.adspirer.com/pricing).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my TikTok advertising data secure?">
    Yes. Adspirer uses OAuth 2.1 authentication -- your TikTok credentials are never stored on Adspirer's servers. All connections are HTTPS-encrypted with strict security protocols. You can revoke access at any time from your TikTok Business Center.

# Agent Skills Overview
Source: https://www.adspirer.com/docs/agent-skills/overview

Turn your AI assistant into an expert advertising manager. Skills teach AI the right workflow for using Adspirer's 100+ tools—research before creating, validate before launching, confirm before spending.

## The Problem Skills Solve

When you connect an AI assistant to Adspirer, it gains access to 100+ advertising tools. That's powerful. It's also overwhelming.

Without guidance, the AI sees a list of tools and has to guess which order to use them. Should it research keywords before creating a Google Search campaign? Should it validate creative assets before launching a Meta campaign? Should it check connection status before pulling performance data?

The AI doesn't know. So it guesses.

Sometimes it guesses right. Sometimes it tries to create a campaign without keyword research, fails validation, and wastes your time. Sometimes it retries a failed campaign creation five times, burning through your tool call quota.

Skills fix this.

## What Skills Are

Skills are instruction files (SKILL.md) that teach AI assistants the *right way* to use Adspirer's tools. Think of them as a training manual for advertising best practices.

A skill file contains:

* **Workflows:** Step-by-step sequences for common tasks ("to create a Google Search campaign, first research keywords, then validate assets, then create")
* **Safety rules:** Critical guidelines ("always get user confirmation before spending money," "campaigns are created PAUSED," "never retry campaign creation on error")
* **Tool reference:** Descriptions of all 100+ tools with parameters and use cases
* **Platform guidance:** When to use each ad platform, minimum budgets, best practices
* **Troubleshooting:** Common errors and how to handle them

## Before vs. After Skills

### Without Skills

**You:** "Create a Google Ads campaign for my SaaS product"

**AI:** Immediately calls `create_search_campaign`

**Result:** Error: "No keywords provided"

**AI:** Retries with generic keywords

**Result:** Error: "No validated assets"

**AI:** Gives up or suggests manual intervention

### With Skills

**You:** "Create a Google Ads campaign for my SaaS product"

**AI:** Follows the workflow:

1. Calls `get_connections_status` (verify you're managing the right account)
2. Calls `research_keywords` with your product description
3. Shows you keyword suggestions with real CPC data
4. Calls `discover_existing_assets` (check if you have images/headlines already)
5. Calls `suggest_ad_content` if you need new headlines/descriptions
6. Calls `validate_and_prepare_assets`
7. Calls `create_search_campaign` with all validated data
8. Asks for your confirmation before creating the campaign
9. Campaign created PAUSED, ready for your review

Skills turn a vague prompt into a complete, validated workflow.

### OpenClaw

Skills are bundled with the plugin. No separate installation needed:

```bash theme={null}
openclaw plugins install openclaw-adspirer
```

## What Skills Include

### 1. Core Workflows

Six proven workflows for common advertising tasks:

* **Performance Analysis:** Cross-platform reporting, anomaly detection, wasted spend audits
* **Keyword Research:** Google Ads keyword discovery with real CPC data
* **Campaign Creation:** Platform-specific flows for Google, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok

* Risk of expensive mistakes (wrong budget, skipped validation)

### With Skills

* The AI follows proven workflows
* Workflows complete successfully on first try
* Safety rules prevent expensive mistakes
* Campaign creation takes 1-2 prompts
* You review and approve instead of troubleshooting

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need skills to use Adspirer?">
    No. Skills are optional but highly recommended. Without skills, you'll need to be more explicit in your prompts ("first research keywords, then validate assets, then create the campaign"). With skills, the AI knows to do this automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I customize skills for my workflow?">
    Yes. Skills are plain markdown files. Edit them to change default behaviors, add custom workflows, or modify safety rules. Changes take effect immediately (or after restarting your AI client).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do skills work with ChatGPT and Claude web?">
    No. ChatGPT and Claude (web/desktop) don't support skills files. They use Adspirer via MCP connectors, which have full tool access but no workflow enforcement. Consider switching to [Claude Code](/ai-clients/claude-code) or [Cursor](/ai-clients/cursor) if you want skills.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How big are skill files?">
    It varies by client:

    * **Claude Code / Cursor:** \~8KB SKILL.md
    * **Codex:** \~8KB SKILL.md
    * **OpenClaw:** 14.4KB SKILL.md (most comprehensive)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do skills slow down the AI?">
    No. The AI reads the skill file once when it starts, not on every prompt. There's no performance impact.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tool Call Best Practices

<Note>
  * **Always start with `get_connections_status`:** Verify the correct ad account is active before using platform-specific tools
  * **Chain Read tools before Write tools:** Research, validate, then create. Never jump straight to campaign creation.
  * **Ask for user confirmation before Write tools:** Present the plan, get approval, then execute.
  * **Never retry Write tools on error:** If a campaign creation fails, report the error and wait for user input. Don't auto-retry.
  * **Format results as tables:** Performance data should be scannable (columns: metric, value, change vs. previous period)
</Note>

# Core Workflows
Source: https://www.adspirer.com/docs/agent-skills/workflows

Complete workflows for ad campaign management. Step-by-step tool sequences for Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and TikTok Ads campaign creation, optimization, and analysis.

Exact tool sequences for campaign creation, optimization, and analysis. These are the workflows that agent skills enforce automatically.

## 1. Performance Analysis (Cross-Platform)

Pull metrics from all connected ad platforms and present a unified view.

### Tool Sequence

```
1. get_connections_status
   (confirm which platforms are connected)
2. get_campaign_performance (Google Ads)
3. get_meta_campaign_performance (Meta Ads)
4. get_linkedin_campaign_performance (LinkedIn Ads)
5. get_tiktok_campaign_performance (TikTok Ads)
   (run in parallel if multi-platform)
6. Present side-by-side comparison table
```

### Output Format

Results should be formatted as a table with columns: Platform, Spend, Conversions, CPA, ROAS, CTR.

### Deep Analysis Tools (Optional)

* `analyze_wasted_spend` (Google) -- Find keywords with spend but no conversions
* `detect_meta_creative_fatigue` (Meta) -- Identify declining ad performance
* `explain_performance_anomaly` (any platform) -- Diagnose sudden CPA spikes or CTR drops

## 2. Google Search Campaign Creation

Five-step workflow. Skip a step = campaign creation fails.

### Tool Sequence

```
1. get_connections_status
   (verify Google Ads is connected)
2. research_keywords
   (input: business_description, seed_keywords, target_location)
   (output: keyword suggestions with real CPC data)
3. discover_existing_assets
   (check if user has images/headlines in Google Ads already)
4. suggest_ad_content (if new assets needed)
   (generate headlines, descriptions within Google's character limits)
5. validate_and_prepare_assets
   (verify assets meet Google's requirements)
6. create_search_campaign
   (campaign created PAUSED)
7. ASK USER FOR CONFIRMATION before proceeding
```

### Key Parameters

* **research\_keywords:** business\_description, seed\_keywords, target\_location (e.g., "United States")
* **create\_search\_campaign:** campaign\_name, daily\_budget (min \$10), asset\_bundle, targeting

### Safety Rules

<Warning>
  * Never skip keyword research (even if user provides keywords -- validate CPC data)
  * Always validate assets before campaign creation
  * Campaign is created PAUSED -- user reviews before launching
</Warning>

## 3. Google PMax Campaign Creation

Performance Max campaigns require high-quality assets. Four-step workflow.

### Tool Sequence

```
1. get_connections_status
2. discover_existing_assets
   (check for high-quality images, videos, logos)
3. help_user_upload (if assets missing)
   (guide user to upload to Google Merchant Center or provide URLs)
4. validate_and_prepare_assets
   (PMax requires: 5+ images, 1+ video, 5+ headlines, 5+ descriptions)
5. create_pmax_campaign
   (campaign created PAUSED)
6. ASK USER FOR CONFIRMATION
```

### Asset Requirements

* Minimum 5 images (1200x628px landscape + 1200x1200px square)
* Minimum 1 video (under 30 seconds recommended)
* 5 headlines (max 30 chars each)
* 5 descriptions (max 90 chars each)
* 1 logo (1200x1200px)

## 4. Meta Campaign Creation

Six-step workflow for Facebook & Instagram campaigns.

### Tool Sequence

```
1. get_connections_status
   (verify Meta Ads is connected)
2. search_meta_targeting
   (find audiences by interests, demographics, behaviors)
   (output: targeting options with audience size estimates)
3. select_meta_campaign_type
   (image, video, or carousel based on user's creative)
4. discover_meta_assets
   (check existing creatives in Meta)
5. validate_and_prepare_meta_assets
   (verify image/video URLs meet Meta requirements)
6. create_meta_image_campaign | create_meta_video_campaign | create_meta_carousel_campaign
   (campaign created PAUSED)
7. ASK USER FOR CONFIRMATION
```

### Creative Requirements by Type

* **Image:** 1080x1080px, JPG/PNG, under 30MB
* **Video:** 1080x1080px, MP4/MOV, under 4GB, 1-240 seconds
* **Carousel:** 2-10 cards, each 1080x1080px

### Safety Rules

<Warning>
  * Creative assets must be provided as URLs (Google Drive, Dropbox, S3)
  * Validate creative URLs are publicly accessible before campaign creation
  * Minimum \$5/day budget per ad set
</Warning>

## 5. LinkedIn Campaign Creation

Five-step workflow for B2B sponsored content.

### Tool Sequence

```
1. get_linkedin_organizations
   (list user's company pages, select one to advertise under)
2. search_linkedin_targeting | research_business_for_linkedin_targeting
   (find B2B audiences by job title, industry, company size, seniority)
   (output: targeting options with audience size)
3. discover_linkedin_assets
   (check existing creatives)
4. validate_and_prepare_linkedin_assets
   (verify images meet LinkedIn requirements)
5. create_linkedin_image_campaign
   (campaign created PAUSED)
6. ASK USER FOR CONFIRMATION
```

### Targeting Best Practices

<Tip>
  * Combine job titles + industries (e.g., "Marketing Manager" + "Computer Software")
  * Add seniority filter for decision-makers (Director, VP, C-level)
  * Use company size to match your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)
  * Minimum audience size: 300 members (LinkedIn requirement)
</Tip>

### Safety Rules

<Warning>
  * Must select organization first (no org = campaign creation fails)
  * Minimum \$10/day budget
  * Image dimensions: 1200x627px or 1200x1200px
</Warning>

## 6. TikTok Campaign Creation

Three-step workflow (simpler than other platforms).

### Tool Sequence

```
1. get_connections_status
   (verify TikTok Ads is connected)
2. discover_tiktok_assets
   (check existing videos)
3. validate_and_prepare_tiktok_assets
   (verify video meets TikTok requirements: 9:16 vertical, 5-60 seconds)
4. create_tiktok_campaign
   (campaign created PAUSED)
5. ASK USER FOR CONFIRMATION
```

### Creative Requirements

* Vertical video: 9:16 aspect ratio (1080x1920px)
* Duration: 5-60 seconds (9-15 seconds performs best)
* Format: MP4 or MOV
* File size: Under 500MB

## 7. Budget Optimization Workflow

Reallocate spend based on performance data.

### Tool Sequence (Per Platform)

```
1. get_campaign_performance (pull last 30 days)
2. optimize_budget_allocation (Google)
   OR optimize_meta_budget (Meta)
   OR optimize_linkedin_budget (LinkedIn)
   (analyzes ROAS or CPA, suggests reallocation)
3. Present recommendations in table:
   - Current budget allocation
   - Recommended budget allocation
   - Expected impact (conversions gained)
4. ASK USER FOR APPROVAL before executing changes
```

### Optimization Logic

* Shift budget from low-ROAS campaigns to high-ROAS campaigns
* Increase spend on campaigns with CPA below target
* Decrease or pause campaigns with CPA 2x+ above target
* Maintain minimum budgets per platform ($10 Google/LinkedIn, $5 Meta)

## 8. Account Management Workflow

Managing multiple ad accounts and checking system status.

### Tool Sequence

```
1. get_connections_status
   (shows all connected platforms and account IDs)
2. switch_primary_account (if managing multiple accounts)
   (change active account for subsequent tool calls)
3. get_usage_status
   (check Adspirer plan limits: tool calls used/remaining)
4. get_business_profile
   (view user's Adspirer account details)
```

### When to Use

* At the start of every session (verify correct account is active)
* Before creating campaigns (confirm you're in the right ad account)
* When switching between client accounts (agencies managing multiple advertisers)

## 9. Automation Workflow

Schedule recurring tasks and set up monitoring.

### Available Automation Tools

* `schedule_brief` -- Schedule daily/weekly performance summaries
* `create_monitor` -- Set alerts for CPA spikes, budget overspend, etc.
* `list_monitors` -- View active monitors
* `generate_report_now` -- Generate ad-hoc cross-platform reports
* `list_scheduled_tasks` -- View all scheduled briefs and reports

### Example: Daily Performance Brief

```python theme={null}
schedule_brief(
  platforms=["google", "meta", "linkedin"],
  frequency="daily",
  time="08:00 AM",
  metrics=["spend", "conversions", "cpa"],
  delivery_method="email"
)
```

### Example: CPA Spike Monitor

```python theme={null}
create_monitor(
  platform="google",
  metric="cpa",
  threshold=50,  # alert if CPA goes above $50
  condition="exceeds",
  alert_method="slack"
)
```

## Workflow Principles

These rules apply to ALL workflows:

<Note>
  1. **Always start with connections check:** Run `get_connections_status` before platform-specific tools
  2. **Read before write:** Research/validate before creating campaigns
  3. **User confirmation required:** Ask before any action that affects spend
  4. **Campaigns created PAUSED:** User reviews before launching live
  5. **Never retry on error:** Report failures, don't auto-retry campaign creation
  6. **Format results as tables:** Make data scannable (columns: metric name, value, change vs. previous period)
</Note>

# Claude Code Setup Guide
Source: https://www.adspirer.com/docs/ai-clients/claude-code

Connect Claude Code to Adspirer MCP in 2 minutes. Manage Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and TikTok Ads from your terminal with 100+ tools.

Manage all your ad campaigns from the terminal. One command to connect, 100+ tools to use.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
  * Claude Code installed:

  ```bash theme={null}
  npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
  ```

  * An Adspirer account ([free to start](https://adspirer.ai/sign-up))
  * At least one ad platform account: Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, or TikTok Ads
  * macOS or Linux (Windows requires WSL)
</Note>

## Setup (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Add the Adspirer MCP Server

One command. That's the entire setup:

```bash theme={null}
claude mcp add --transport http adspirer https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp
```

This tells Claude Code where to find Adspirer's 100+ advertising tools. The connection uses streamable HTTP transport for real-time progress updates.

### Step 2: Authenticate

Next time you ask Claude Code about your ad accounts, it'll prompt you to sign in. Your browser opens automatically for OAuth 2.1 authorization -- no passwords stored, no API keys to manage.

You'll see:

```
Adspirer requires authorization. Opening browser...
```

Sign in, connect your ad platforms (Google, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok), and you're done.

### Step 3: Install Agent Skills (Optional But Recommended)

Skills are instruction files that teach Claude the *right way* to use Adspirer's tools. Without skills, Claude sees 100+ tools and has to guess which order to call them. With skills, it follows proven workflows -- research keywords before creating campaigns, validate assets before launching, always confirm before spending money.

Install skills:

```bash theme={null}
git clone https://github.com/amekala/ads-mcp.git /tmp/ads-mcp
cp -r /tmp/ads-mcp/plugins/claude/adspirer/skills/ad-campaign-management ~/.claude/skills/
```

That's it. Claude now knows to check connections first, research before creating, and present results in readable tables.

### Step 4: Verify Your Setup

Run a test prompt:

```
Check my connected ad platforms
```

You should see a table showing your connected accounts across Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and TikTok Ads -- along with account IDs, names, and connection status.

## What You Can Do

100+ tools across 4 ad platforms. Here's what matters:

| Platform         | Tools | Key Capabilities                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Google Ads**   | 39    | Keyword research with real CPC data, Search & PMax campaigns, wasted spend analysis, budget optimization, ad extensions, asset management |
| **LinkedIn Ads** | 28    | Sponsored content, lead gen forms, B2B targeting (job titles, industries, seniority), creative performance analysis                       |
| **Meta Ads**     | 20    | Image/video/carousel campaigns, audience targeting, creative fatigue detection, placement optimization                                    |
| **TikTok Ads**   | 4     | In-feed campaigns, asset validation, performance analysis                                                                                 |

Plus 8 automation tools: scheduled briefs, performance monitors, cross-platform reports.

## Example Prompts

What to actually say once you're set up:

### Google Search Campaign

```
Create a Google Ads search campaign for my SaaS product:
- Product: project management tool for remote teams
- Target: team leads and ops managers at companies with 20-200 employees
- Budget: $60/day
- Research keywords with real CPC data first
- Group keywords by intent (branded, competitor, feature-based)
```

### Google PMax Campaign

```
Set up a Performance Max campaign for my e-commerce store:
- Product: organic dog treats, $24.99 avg order value
- Target ROAS: 400%
- I have product images at these URLs: [paste URLs]
- Write 5 headlines and 3 descriptions
- Use my existing Google Merchant Center feed
```

### Meta Ads Campaign

```
Create a Meta image campaign for my skincare brand:
- Product: anti-aging serum for women 30-55
- Budget: $40/day
- Target interests: skincare, beauty, wellness, anti-aging
- Image URL: [paste URL]
- Write 3 primary text variations and 2 headlines
- Optimize for purchases
```

### LinkedIn Ads Campaign

```
Launch a LinkedIn sponsored content campaign:
- Product: enterprise data analytics platform
- Target: VPs and Directors of Data/Analytics at companies with 500+ employees
- Industries: financial services, healthcare, technology
- Budget: $100/day
- Goal: lead generation with a whitepaper download
- Image URL: [paste URL]
```

### Cross-Platform Audit

```
Audit all my ad accounts for the last 30 days:
- Google: find wasted spend (keywords with clicks but zero conversions)
- Meta: check for creative fatigue (frequency > 3, declining CTR)
- LinkedIn: compare CPA across audience segments

Give me a prioritized action list with estimated monthly savings.
```

## Safety Features

Adspirer's agent skills enforce safety rules to prevent accidental spend:

* **All campaigns created PAUSED:** You review before they go live
* **User confirmation required:** Claude asks before any action that affects spend
* **Read-before-write:** Skills force research and validation before campaign creation
* **Connection status checks:** Always verifies you're managing the right account first
* **No automatic retries:** If a campaign creation fails, Claude won't retry without asking

## Troubleshooting

### "MCP server not found" error

Make sure you ran the add command exactly as written. Check your MCP config:

```bash theme={null}
cat ~/.config/claude/mcp.json
```

You should see an entry for "adspirer" with the URL `https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp`.

### Authentication keeps failing

Clear your browser cache or try a different browser. The OAuth flow uses PKCE for security -- some browser extensions can interfere. Disable ad blockers temporarily.

### Tools not working after connecting

Check your Adspirer account status at [adspirer.ai](https://adspirer.ai). Free accounts get 10 tool calls/month. If you've hit the limit, upgrade to Plus ($25/mo for 50 calls) or Pro ($75/mo for 100 calls).

### Skills not loading

Verify the skills directory exists:

```bash theme={null}
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/ad-campaign-management/
```

You should see a SKILL.md file. If not, re-run the copy command from Step 3.

### Claude doesn't seem to follow the workflows

Make sure skills are installed correctly. Also, be specific in your prompts -- instead of "create a campaign," say "create a Google Ads search campaign for \[specific product] with \[specific budget]." The more context you give, the better Claude follows the workflow.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to know MCP to use this?">
    No. MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the plumbing -- you don't interact with it directly. You just talk to Claude in plain English. The MCP connection happens behind the scenes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Claude Code and Claude Desktop?">
    Claude Code is the terminal-based developer tool. Claude Desktop is the GUI app with chat and Cowork modes. Both support Adspirer through MCP. Use Claude Code if you live in the terminal. Use [Claude Desktop](https://www.adspirer.com/integrations/claude) if you prefer a visual interface.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I manage multiple ad accounts?">
    Yes. Adspirer supports multiple accounts per platform. Use the `switch_primary_account` tool to change which account you're managing, or specify the account ID in your prompts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does this cost?">
    Adspirer pricing is based on tool calls, not ad spend. Free tier: 10 calls/month. Plus: $25/mo for 50 calls. Pro: $75/mo for 100 calls. See the [full pricing breakdown](https://www.adspirer.com/pricing).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my data safe?">
    Yes. Adspirer uses OAuth 2.1 with PKCE -- we never see your passwords. Your ad account credentials live with Google/Meta/LinkedIn/TikTok. We only get read/write permissions you explicitly authorize. You can revoke access anytime from your ad platform's security settings.

# Codex Setup Guide
Source: https://www.adspirer.com/docs/ai-clients/codex

Connect Codex to Adspirer MCP for autonomous ad management across Google, Meta, LinkedIn, and TikTok Ads. AI agents that optimize daily.

Autonomous ad campaign management. Your AI agent runs campaigns while you sleep.

## What Makes Codex Different

Most AI tools are assistants. They answer questions. They generate copy. They analyze data when you ask.

Codex is autonomous. You define the goal -- "check my ad performance every morning and flag anything unusual" -- and the agent runs that task on a schedule. No human in the loop. It wakes up, pulls your campaign data, analyzes it, and sends you a summary. If your cost-per-acquisition spikes 40% overnight, you get an alert before you've had coffee.

When you connect Codex to Adspirer, you get 100+ advertising tools that run on a schedule. It's an AI ad manager that operates 24/7.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
  * OpenAI Codex CLI installed ([install instructions](https://github.com/openai/codex))
  * An Adspirer account ([free to start](https://adspirer.ai/sign-up))
  * At least one ad platform account: Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, or TikTok Ads
  * Basic understanding of YAML config files (we provide the template)
</Note>

## Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Add Adspirer to Codex Config

Edit your Codex config file at `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```bash theme={null}
[mcp_servers.adspirer]
url = "https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp"
```

If the file doesn't exist, create it. If you already have other MCP servers configured, just add the `[mcp_servers.adspirer]` section.

### Step 2: Install Agent Skills

Skills teach the Codex agent how to use Adspirer's 100+ tools in the right order. Without skills, the agent might try to create a campaign before researching keywords. With skills, it follows proven workflows.

```bash theme={null}
git clone https://github.com/amekala/ads-mcp.git /tmp/ads-mcp
cp /tmp/ads-mcp/plugins/codex/adspirer/SKILL.md ~/.codex/skills/adspirer-ads.md
```

### Step 3: Create an Autonomous Agent

This is where Codex gets powerful. You define an agent with a default task -- what it should do when it runs autonomously.

Create `~/.codex/agents/adspirer-ads.yaml`:

```bash theme={null}
interface:
  display_name: "Adspirer Ads Agent"
  short_description: "Manage ad campaigns across Google, Meta, LinkedIn & TikTok"
  default_prompt: "Check connected ad platforms and summarize recent campaign performance across all active accounts."

dependencies:
  tools:
    - type: "mcp"
      value: "adspirer"
      transport: "streamable_http"
      url: "https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp"
```

The `default_prompt` is what the agent runs when you invoke it without a specific task. Think of it as the agent's daily routine.

### Step 4: Authenticate

Run the agent for the first time:

```
codex run adspirer-ads
```

Your browser opens for OAuth 2.1 authorization. Sign in to Adspirer, connect your ad platforms (Google, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok), and approve permissions.

### Step 5: Verify the Connection

The agent should run its default prompt and show you a summary of your connected accounts and recent campaign performance. If you see metrics from your ad platforms, you're set.

## What You Can Do

100+ tools across 4 ad platforms, available for autonomous or on-demand tasks:

| Platform         | Tools | Key Capabilities                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Google Ads**   | 39    | Keyword research, Search & PMax campaigns, wasted spend detection, budget reallocation, search term analysis  |
| **LinkedIn Ads** | 28    | B2B targeting (job titles, industries, company size), sponsored content, lead gen forms, performance analysis |
| **Meta Ads**     | 20    | Image/video/carousel campaigns, creative fatigue detection, audience targeting, placement optimization        |
| **TikTok Ads**   | 4     | In-feed campaigns, asset validation, performance tracking                                                     |

## Autonomous Workflows (The Real Use Case)

Here's why people use Codex with Adspirer:

### Daily Performance Check-In

**Agent YAML default\_prompt:**

```
"Pull yesterday's performance across all my ad platforms.
Compare to the previous 7-day average.
Flag any campaigns with CPA increases over 30% or spend increases over 50%.
Send me a summary."
```

Schedule this to run every morning at 8am. You wake up to a performance summary in your inbox or Slack. No dashboards to check.

### Weekly Wasted Spend Audit

**Agent YAML default\_prompt:**

```
"Audit my Google Ads account for wasted spend in the last 7 days.
Find keywords with spend but zero conversions.
For each keyword, recommend: pause it, add a negative keyword, or lower the bid.
Total up potential monthly savings."
```

Run this every Monday. The agent finds money leaks and tells you exactly what to fix.

### Budget Rebalancing

**Agent YAML default\_prompt:**

```
"Analyze performance across Google and Meta Ads for the last 30 days.
I have $10,000/month total budget.
Recommend how to split the budget for maximum conversions.
Show me current allocation vs recommended allocation."
```

Run this monthly. The agent analyzes cross-platform ROI and recommends where to shift spend.

### Anomaly Detection

**Agent YAML default\_prompt:**

```
"Check all active campaigns across Google, Meta, LinkedIn, and TikTok.
Look for anomalies in the last 24 hours:
- Sudden CPA spikes
- Campaigns that stopped converting
- Unexpected spend increases
Alert me immediately if anything is found."
```

Run this every 6 hours. The agent acts as a 24/7 monitoring system. If something breaks at 3am, you get an alert.

## On-Demand Prompts (Non-Autonomous)

You can also run Codex with one-off prompts instead of the default task:

### Campaign Creation

```
codex run adspirer-ads "Create a Google PMax campaign for my DTC brand:
- Product: premium wireless earbuds, $129 retail price
- Target ROAS: 350%
- I have product images and videos ready
- Write asset group headlines and descriptions
- Use my Google Merchant Center feed"
```

### LinkedIn Lead Gen

```
codex run adspirer-ads "Launch a LinkedIn campaign targeting CTOs:
- Company size: 100-1,000 employees
- Industries: fintech, SaaS, cybersecurity
- Product: zero-trust security platform
- Budget: $150/day
- Goal: whitepaper downloads
- Image URL: [paste URL]"
```

### Cross-Platform Report

```
codex run adspirer-ads "Generate a Q1 2026 performance report.
Pull data from Google Ads, Meta Ads, and LinkedIn Ads.
Include: total spend, conversions, ROAS by platform.
Format as markdown."
```

## Safety Features (Critical for Autonomous Agents)

When an AI agent runs without human oversight, safety matters. Adspirer enforces these rules:

* **All campaigns created PAUSED:** Even in autonomous mode, campaigns don't launch until you manually approve them
* **No budget changes without confirmation:** The agent can analyze and recommend budget changes, but it can't execute them autonomously
* **Read-before-write workflows:** Skills force research and validation before any campaign creation
* **Connection status checks:** Agent verifies it's managing the correct account before taking any action
* **No automatic retries:** If a tool call fails, the agent reports the error instead of retrying blindly

Bottom line: Autonomous doesn't mean uncontrolled. The agent analyzes, recommends, and alerts -- but you make the final spending decisions.

## Troubleshooting

### "MCP server not found" error

Check your `~/.codex/config.toml` file:

```bash theme={null}
cat ~/.codex/config.toml
```

Make sure the `[mcp_servers.adspirer]` section exists with the correct URL.

### Agent doesn't follow workflows correctly

Verify the SKILL.md file is in the right location:

```bash theme={null}
cat ~/.codex/skills/adspirer-ads.md
```

If it's missing, re-run the copy command from Step 2.

### OAuth authentication keeps failing

Codex uses your system's default browser for OAuth. If it's not opening:

* Check your default browser setting
* Try manually visiting [adspirer.ai](https://adspirer.ai) and signing in first
* Disable browser extensions that might block redirects

### Agent runs but doesn't produce output

Check the Codex logs:

```bash theme={null}
codex logs adspirer-ads
```

Look for errors related to tool calls or authentication. If you see "tool call limit exceeded," upgrade your Adspirer plan at [adspirer.ai](https://adspirer.ai).

### Scheduled agent isn't running

Codex doesn't include a built-in scheduler. Use cron (Linux/Mac) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to run the agent on a schedule:

```bash theme={null}
# Run daily at 8am
0 8 * * * /usr/local/bin/codex run adspirer-ads
```

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can the agent actually spend money autonomously?">
    No. All campaigns are created PAUSED, and budget changes require user confirmation. The agent can analyze, recommend, and alert -- but you approve spending decisions manually.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Codex and Claude Code?">
    [Claude Code](/ai-clients/claude-code) is interactive -- you ask it to do something, it does it. Codex is autonomous -- you define a task once, and it runs on a schedule. Use Claude Code for ad-hoc analysis. Use Codex for recurring tasks like daily performance checks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I change the agent's default task?">
    Edit the `default_prompt` in `~/.codex/agents/adspirer-ads.yaml`. Restart the agent for changes to take effect.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I run multiple agents for different ad accounts?">
    Yes. Create separate agent YAML files (e.g., `client-a-ads.yaml`, `client-b-ads.yaml`) with different default prompts. Each agent can specify which Adspirer account to use via the `switch_primary_account` tool.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does this cost?">
    Adspirer pricing is based on tool calls. Free tier: 10 calls/month. Plus: $25/mo for 50 calls. Pro: $75/mo for 100 calls. Autonomous agents typically use 2-5 tool calls per run. See [full pricing details](https://www.adspirer.com/pricing).

# Cursor Setup Guide
Source: https://www.adspirer.com/docs/ai-clients/cursor

Connect Cursor IDE to Adspirer MCP. Manage Google, Meta, LinkedIn, and TikTok Ads from your editor with 100+ tools and Cursor Rules.

Manage ads from your code editor. 100+ tools, automatic workflow rules, zero context-switching.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
  * Cursor IDE installed ([download here](https://cursor.sh))
  * An Adspirer account ([free to start](https://adspirer.ai/sign-up))
  * At least one ad platform account: Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, or TikTok Ads
</Note>

## Setup (3 Minutes)

### Step 1: Add Adspirer to Your MCP Config

Open Cursor's AI chat (Cmd+L or Ctrl+L) and paste this prompt:

```
Add the Adspirer MCP server to my global MCP config.
Server URL: https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp
```

Cursor will create or update your `~/.cursor/mcp.json` automatically.

<Note>
  **Manual alternative**

  If you prefer, create or edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global) or `.cursor/mcp.json` (per-project) directly:

  ```bash theme={null}
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "adspirer": {
        "url": "https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
</Note>

### Step 2: Restart Cursor

MCP configs load on startup. Close and reopen Cursor for the connection to register.

### Step 3: Install Agent Skills (Recommended)

Skills teach Cursor the correct workflow for using Adspirer's 100+ tools. Without skills, Cursor sees the tools but doesn't know the right order -- should it research keywords before creating a campaign? Should it validate assets first? Skills answer these questions.

Install skills:

```bash theme={null}
git clone https://github.com/amekala/ads-mcp.git /tmp/ads-mcp
cp -r /tmp/ads-mcp/plugins/cursor/adspirer/skills/ad-campaign-management ~/.cursor/skills/
```

### Step 4: Install Cursor Rules (Optional But Powerful)

Cursor Rules are automatic instructions that trigger based on context. Adspirer's rule file enforces safety and best practices:

* Always check `get_connections_status` before running other tools
* Research keywords before creating Google Search campaigns
* Validate assets before launching campaigns
* Confirm with the user before any action that affects spend
* Never retry failed campaign creation without asking

To install Cursor Rules:

```bash theme={null}
cp /tmp/ads-mcp/plugins/cursor/adspirer/rules/use-adspirer.mdc .cursor/rules/
```

The rule is set to `alwaysApply: true`, so Cursor will automatically enforce these workflows whenever you interact with Adspirer tools.

### Step 5: Authenticate

Next time you ask Cursor to use an Adspirer tool, it'll prompt you to sign in. Your browser opens automatically for OAuth 2.1 authorization. Sign in, connect your ad platforms, done.

### Step 6: Verify Your Setup

Open Cursor's AI chat (Cmd+L or Ctrl+L) and say:

```
Check my connected ad platforms
```

You should see a table showing your connected accounts -- Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads -- with account names, IDs, and connection status.

## What You Can Do

100+ tools across 4 ad platforms, accessible from Cursor's AI chat or inline editing:

| Platform         | Tools | Key Capabilities                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Google Ads**   | 39    | Keyword research, Search & PMax campaigns, wasted spend analysis, budget optimization, search term reports, ad extensions |
| **LinkedIn Ads** | 28    | Sponsored content, B2B targeting (job titles, industries, company size), lead gen forms, creative analysis                |
| **Meta Ads**     | 20    | Image/video/carousel ads, audience targeting, placement optimization, creative fatigue detection                          |
| **TikTok Ads**   | 4     | In-feed campaigns, asset validation, performance tracking                                                                 |

Plus 8 automation tools for scheduling, monitoring, and cross-platform reporting.

## Example Prompts

What to actually say to Cursor once you're connected:

### Google Search Campaign

```
Create a Google Search campaign for my B2B software:
- Product: cloud-based inventory management for restaurants
- Target: restaurant owners and ops managers
- Budget: $75/day
- Research keywords with real CPC data first
- Suggest negative keywords to avoid irrelevant clicks
```

### Google PMax Campaign

```
Build a Performance Max campaign for my online course:
- Product: "Advanced Python for Data Science" course, $199
- Target ROAS: 300%
- I have these image assets: [paste URLs]
- Write headlines and descriptions optimized for conversions
- Set up conversion tracking for purchases
```

### Meta Ads Creative Testing

```
Set up a Meta carousel campaign for my furniture store:
- Products: 4 best-selling sofas ($800-$2,000 range)
- Target: homeowners aged 28-45, interests in interior design and home decor
- Budget: $50/day
- Image URLs: [paste 4 URLs]
- Write unique copy for each carousel card
- Optimize for purchases
```

### LinkedIn B2B Lead Gen

```
Create a LinkedIn campaign targeting CFOs and Finance Directors:
- Company size: 200-5,000 employees
- Industries: manufacturing, logistics, retail
- Product: AP automation software
- Budget: $120/day
- Goal: demo request sign-ups
- Use this image: [paste URL]
```

### Cross-Platform Performance Report

```
Pull performance data from all my connected platforms for the last 30 days.
Create a markdown report with:
- Executive summary with key metrics per platform
- Top 3 campaigns by ROAS across all platforms
- Wasted spend analysis (Google: zero-conversion keywords, Meta: fatigued creatives)
- Budget reallocation recommendations for next month
```

## How Cursor Rules Improve Your Workflow

If you installed the Cursor Rule in Step 4, here's what changes:

### Before Rules:

**You:** "Create a Google Ads campaign for running shoes"

**Cursor:** Immediately calls `create_search_campaign` with generic parameters -- fails because no keyword research, no asset validation.

### After Rules:

**You:** "Create a Google Ads campaign for running shoes"

**Cursor:** Automatically follows the workflow:

1. Calls `get_connections_status` (verify you're managing the right account)
2. Calls `research_keywords` with "running shoes" seed keywords
3. Shows you CPC data and keyword suggestions
4. Calls `discover_existing_assets` (check if you have images/headlines already)
5. Calls `validate_and_prepare_assets` (make sure assets meet Google's requirements)
6. Calls `create_search_campaign` with validated data
7. **Asks for your confirmation** before actually creating the campaign

Rules turn one vague prompt into a complete, validated workflow. You still control the final decision -- nothing launches without your approval.

## Safety Features

* **All campaigns created PAUSED:** Review before they spend money
* **User confirmation required:** Cursor asks before any write action
* **Read-before-write enforcement:** Skills prevent campaign creation without research
* **Connection checks:** Always verifies you're managing the correct account first
* **No automatic retries:** If something fails, Cursor waits for your input instead of retrying blindly

## Troubleshooting

### Cursor doesn't recognize Adspirer tools

Check your mcp.json file:

```bash theme={null}
cat ~/.cursor/mcp.json
```

Make sure the JSON is valid (no trailing commas, proper quotes). Restart Cursor after any config changes.

### "Connection failed" error

Your firewall or network might be blocking the MCP connection. Try:

* Whitelisting `mcp.adspirer.com` in your firewall settings
* Checking if your company VPN blocks external MCP servers
* Testing with a different network (mobile hotspot) to isolate the issue

### Skills aren't working

Verify the skills directory:

```bash theme={null}
ls -la ~/.cursor/skills/ad-campaign-management/
```

You should see a SKILL.md file. If the directory doesn't exist, re-run the copy command from Step 3.

### Cursor Rules not triggering

Check that the rule file is in the right location:

```bash theme={null}
ls -la .cursor/rules/
```

You should see `use-adspirer.mdc`. If it's not there, copy it from the GitHub repo again. Rules are per-project, so each project needs its own copy.

### OAuth flow not opening

Some browser settings block automatic OAuth redirects. Try:

* Manually visiting [adspirer.ai](https://adspirer.ai) and signing in first
* Checking your default browser settings (Cursor uses your system default)
* Disabling browser extensions that might block pop-ups or redirects

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between global and per-project config?">
    **Global (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):** Adspirer works in every Cursor project. Use this if you manage ads regularly.

    **Per-project (`.cursor/mcp.json`):** Adspirer only works in that specific project. Use this if you're working on a client's codebase and want ad management tools only for that client.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Adspirer with Cursor Composer?">
    Yes. Cursor Composer (multi-file editing mode) has full access to Adspirer tools. You can ask Composer to analyze campaigns, generate reports, and save the output as markdown files in your project -- all in one flow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need both Skills and Cursor Rules?">
    No, but they complement each other. Skills teach Cursor *how* to use the tools. Cursor Rules enforce *when* and *why* to use them. Install both for the best experience, or start with Skills if you only want one.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does Adspirer cost?">
    Pricing is based on tool calls, not ad spend. Free tier: 10 calls/month. Plus: $25/mo for 50 calls. Pro: $75/mo for 100 calls. See [full pricing details](https://www.adspirer.com/pricing).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I manage multiple ad accounts?">
    Yes. Connect multiple Google Ads accounts, multiple Meta Business Managers, etc. Use the `switch_primary_account` tool to change which account you're managing, or specify the account ID in your prompts.

# Custom GPT Setup Guide
Source: https://www.adspirer.com/docs/ai-clients/custom-gpt

Use Adspirer directly inside ChatGPT. Manage Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and TikTok Ads campaigns with natural language — no MCP setup required.

Use Adspirer directly in ChatGPT. No terminal, no IDE, no MCP configuration. Just open ChatGPT and start managing ad campaigns.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
  * ChatGPT Plus, Team, or Enterprise subscription (Custom GPTs require a paid plan)
  * An Adspirer account ([free to start](https://adspirer.ai/sign-up))
  * At least one ad platform account: Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, or TikTok Ads
</Note>

## Setup

### Step 1: Find the Adspirer GPT

Open ChatGPT and search for "Adspirer" in the GPT Store, or use the direct link:

```
https://chatgpt.com/g/adspirer
```

### Step 2: Start a Conversation

Click **Start Chat**. The Adspirer GPT comes pre-configured with instructions for managing ad campaigns across all supported platforms.

### Step 3: Connect Your Ad Accounts

On your first interaction, the GPT will prompt you to connect your ad platforms. Say:

```
Connect my ad accounts
```

Your browser opens for OAuth authorization. Sign in to each platform you want to manage (Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads) and approve permissions.

### Step 4: Verify Your Setup

```
Check my connected ad platforms
```

You should see a table showing your connected accounts, account names, IDs, and active status.

## How It Works

The Adspirer Custom GPT uses OpenAI's Actions feature to connect to Adspirer's API. Under the hood:

1. You type a natural language request ("Create a Google Search campaign for...")
2. The GPT translates your request into Adspirer tool calls
3. Adspirer executes the action via ad platform APIs (Google, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok)
4. Results come back in the chat — formatted tables, recommendations, confirmations

No MCP setup. No terminal commands. No configuration files. It just works inside ChatGPT.

## What You Can Do

100+ tools across 4 ad platforms:

| Platform         | Tools | Key Capabilities                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Google Ads**   | 39    | Keyword research with real CPC data, Search & PMax campaigns, wasted spend analysis, budget optimization |
| **Meta Ads**     | 20    | Image/video/carousel campaigns, audience targeting, creative fatigue detection, placement optimization   |
| **LinkedIn Ads** | 28    | B2B targeting (job titles, industries, seniority), sponsored content, lead gen forms                     |
| **TikTok Ads**   | 4     | In-feed campaigns, asset validation, performance tracking                                                |

## Custom GPT vs MCP Clients

| Feature          | Custom GPT                        | MCP Clients (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Setup**        | Click and go                      | Terminal command                        |
| **Interface**    | ChatGPT web/mobile                | IDE or terminal                         |
| **Agent Skills** | Built into GPT instructions       | Install separately                      |
| **Best for**     | Marketers, non-technical users    | Developers, power users                 |
| **Offline**      | No                                | No                                      |
| **Cost**         | ChatGPT Plus (\$20/mo) + Adspirer | AI client subscription + Adspirer       |

<Tip>
  If you're a developer or live in the terminal, use [Claude Code](/ai-clients/claude-code) or [Cursor](/ai-clients/cursor) instead. If you're a marketer who uses ChatGPT daily, the Custom GPT is the fastest path.
</Tip>

## Safety Features

The Adspirer GPT enforces the same safety rules as all other clients:

* **All campaigns created PAUSED** — you review before they go live
* **Confirmation before spend** — the GPT asks before any budget-affecting action
* **Research-first workflows** — keyword research and asset validation happen before campaign creation
* **Connection checks** — always verifies you're managing the correct account first

## Troubleshooting

### "Adspirer GPT not found" in GPT Store

The GPT may not appear in all regions. Try the direct link above. If still unavailable, use one of our [MCP-based AI clients](/ai-clients/claude-code) instead.

### Authentication keeps failing

Clear your browser cache or try an incognito window. The OAuth flow uses secure tokens — browser extensions (especially ad blockers) can interfere.

### "Action failed" errors

Check your Adspirer account status at [adspirer.ai](https://adspirer.ai). Free accounts get 10 tool calls/month. If you've hit the limit, upgrade to Plus ($25/mo for 50 calls) or Pro ($75/mo for 100 calls).

### GPT not following workflows correctly

Be specific in your prompts. Instead of "create a campaign," say "create a Google Ads search campaign for \[product] with \[budget] targeting \[audience]." The more context you give, the better the GPT follows the correct workflow.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need ChatGPT Plus?">
    Yes. Custom GPTs require ChatGPT Plus (\$20/month), Team, or Enterprise. Free ChatGPT users can't access custom GPTs. If you don't have Plus, use [Claude Code](/ai-clients/claude-code) or [Cursor](/ai-clients/cursor) instead.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use this on mobile?">
    Yes. The Adspirer GPT works in the ChatGPT mobile app (iOS and Android). Same features, same tools.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is this the same as using MCP with Claude?">
    Similar capabilities, different interface. The Custom GPT uses OpenAI Actions (API calls). MCP clients use Model Context Protocol. Both connect to Adspirer's 100+ tools. The Custom GPT is simpler to set up; MCP clients offer more flexibility and agent skills.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does Adspirer cost?">
    Adspirer pricing is based on tool calls, not ad spend. Free tier: 10 calls/month. Plus: $25/mo for 50 calls. Pro: $75/mo for 100 calls. See [full pricing](https://www.adspirer.com/pricing).

# OpenClaw Setup Guide
Source: https://www.adspirer.com/docs/ai-clients/openclaw

Install the Adspirer OpenClaw plugin. 100+ ad tools, 14KB skill file built in, zero configuration. Manage Google, Meta, LinkedIn, and TikTok Ads.

One plugin, 100+ tools, 14KB skill file built in. No separate setup.

## What Makes OpenClaw Different

Every other MCP client gives you access to Adspirer's 100+ tools. That's the baseline.

OpenClaw gives you a complete AI advertising agent -- pre-configured, pre-trained, ready to run campaigns. The plugin includes a 14.4KB SKILL.md file that documents every tool, every workflow, every platform-specific nuance. The plugin doesn't just connect to Adspirer -- it includes a 14.4KB instruction manual that turns OpenClaw into a specialized advertising AI.

You're deploying an expert, not configuring tools.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
  * OpenClaw CLI installed ([download here](https://openclaw.com))
  * Node.js 18+ (for npm installation method)
  * An Adspirer account ([free to start](https://adspirer.ai/sign-up))
  * At least one ad platform account: Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, or TikTok Ads
</Note>

## Setup (3 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install the Adspirer Plugin

Two installation methods. Pick one:

**Method 1: OpenClaw Plugin Manager (Recommended)**

```bash theme={null}
openclaw plugins install openclaw-adspirer
```

**Method 2: NPM**

```bash theme={null}
npm i openclaw-adspirer
```

Both methods install the same plugin. The OpenClaw method handles dependencies automatically. The NPM method gives you more control if you're integrating into an existing Node.js project.

### Step 2: Authenticate with Adspirer

```
openclaw adspirer login
```

Your browser opens for OAuth 2.1 sign-in. Authorize OpenClaw to access your Adspirer account. No API keys, no passwords stored locally.

### Step 3: Connect Your Ad Platforms

```
openclaw adspirer connect
```

This opens `adspirer.com` in your browser. Connect Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads -- or any combination. Each platform has its own OAuth flow. Authorize the platforms you want to manage.

### Step 4: Verify Your Setup

```
openclaw adspirer status
```

You'll see a table showing:

* Connected platforms (Google, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok)
* Account names and IDs
* Connection status (active/expired)
* Available tool count per platform

If everything shows "active," you're ready.

## What You Get: The Skill File

Most MCP integrations give you raw tool access. OpenClaw gives you a 14,400-character instruction manual that covers:

* **100+ tools documented:** Every parameter, every return value, every edge case
* **6 complete workflows:** Performance analysis, keyword research, campaign creation (per platform), budget optimization, account management, automation
* **Platform quick reference:** When to use each platform, minimum budgets, best use cases
* **Safety rules:** What to always check first, what requires user confirmation, what never to retry
* **Troubleshooting guide:** Common errors and how to fix them
* **Example prompts:** Real queries you can copy-paste to get started

This isn't configuration. It's training. OpenClaw reads the SKILL.md file and knows how to behave like an expert advertising manager.

## What You Can Do

100+ tools across 4 ad platforms:

| Platform         | Tools | Key Capabilities                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Google Ads**   | 39    | Keyword research with real CPC data, Search & PMax campaigns, wasted spend analysis, budget optimization, extensions, asset management |
| **LinkedIn Ads** | 28    | B2B targeting (job titles, industries, seniority), sponsored content, lead gen forms, performance analysis                             |
| **Meta Ads**     | 20    | Image/video/carousel campaigns, audience targeting, creative fatigue detection, placement optimization                                 |
| **TikTok Ads**   | 4     | In-feed campaigns, asset validation, performance tracking                                                                              |

Plus 8 automation tools for scheduling, monitoring, and cross-platform reporting.

## Example Commands

What to actually run once you're set up:

### Google Search Campaign

```
openclaw "Create a Google Search campaign for my consulting firm:
- Service: fractional CFO services for startups
- Target: startup founders and CEOs at Series A-B companies
- Budget: $80/day
- Research keywords with real CPC data
- Add negative keywords for 'jobs', 'salary', 'free'"
```

### Google PMax Campaign

```
openclaw "Set up a Performance Max campaign:
- Product: standing desk, $549 retail price
- Target ROAS: 500%
- Product images: [paste URLs]
- Write compelling headlines and descriptions
- Use my Merchant Center product feed"
```

### Meta Ads Campaign

```
openclaw "Create a Meta image campaign for my online course:
- Product: UX design bootcamp, $599 one-time
- Target: designers and career changers aged 24-38
- Interests: UX design, Figma, product design, career growth
- Budget: $55/day
- Image URL: [paste URL]
- Optimize for registrations"
```

### LinkedIn Lead Gen Campaign

```
openclaw "Launch a LinkedIn sponsored content campaign:
- Product: employee engagement platform
- Target: HR VPs and CHROs at enterprises with 1,000+ employees
- Industries: tech, finance, healthcare
- Budget: $130/day
- Goal: book a product demo
- Image URL: [paste URL]"
```

### Cross-Platform Performance Report

```
openclaw "Generate a full performance report for the last 30 days.
Pull data from all connected platforms.
Include:
- Executive summary with key wins and concerns
- Per-platform metrics: spend, conversions, CPA, ROAS
- Wasted spend analysis (Google keywords + Meta creative fatigue)
- Top 5 recommendations for next month
Format as markdown."
```

## The claw\.json Manifest

The plugin includes a manifest file that defines its metadata and permissions:

```bash theme={null}
{
  "name": "adspirer-ads-agent",
  "version": "1.1.0",
  "displayName": "Adspirer Ads Agent",
  "keywords": [
    "advertising",
    "google-ads",
    "meta-ads",
    "linkedin-ads",
    "tiktok-ads",
    "ppc",
    "mcp"
  ],
  "permissions": {
    "network": [
      "mcp.adspirer.com",
      "www.adspirer.com"
    ]
  }
}
```

This tells OpenClaw that the plugin is an advertising agent, which keywords to associate with it, and which domains it's allowed to access. The network permissions ensure the plugin can only connect to Adspirer's servers -- no other external services.

## Safety Features

The skill file includes safety rules. OpenClaw enforces them automatically:

* **All campaigns created PAUSED:** Review before they spend money
* **User confirmation required:** OpenClaw asks before any action that affects spend
* **Read-before-write workflows:** The agent researches keywords before creating campaigns, validates assets before launching
* **Connection status checks:** Always verifies you're managing the correct account first
* **No automatic retries:** If a tool call fails, OpenClaw reports the error instead of retrying blindly
* **Platform-specific minimums:** The agent knows Google Ads requires $10/day minimum, LinkedIn requires $10/day, Meta has no minimum -- and won't let you create campaigns below those thresholds

## Troubleshooting

### "Plugin not found" error

List your installed plugins:

```bash theme={null}
openclaw plugins list
```

If you don't see `openclaw-adspirer`, re-run the install command from Step 1.

### "Not authenticated" error

Your login session might have expired. Re-authenticate:

```
openclaw adspirer login
```

### "No ad platforms connected" warning

Run the connect command:

```
openclaw adspirer connect
```

Make sure you authorize at least one ad platform (Google, Meta, LinkedIn, or TikTok) in the OAuth flow.

### Tools not working or returning errors

Check your account status at [adspirer.ai](https://adspirer.ai). Free accounts get 10 tool calls/month. If you've hit the limit, upgrade to Plus ($25/mo for 50 calls) or Pro ($75/mo for 100 calls).

### Skill file not loading

The skill file is bundled with the plugin. If OpenClaw isn't following the documented workflows, try reinstalling:

```bash theme={null}
openclaw plugins uninstall openclaw-adspirer
openclaw plugins install openclaw-adspirer
```

### Network permission errors

If your firewall blocks the plugin, whitelist these domains:

* `mcp.adspirer.com` (MCP server)
* `www.adspirer.com` (OAuth and account management)

# Windsurf Setup Guide
Source: https://www.adspirer.com/docs/ai-clients/windsurf

Connect Windsurf IDE to Adspirer MCP. Manage Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and TikTok Ads from Codeium's AI-powered editor with 100+ tools.

Manage ads from Windsurf without leaving your editor. 100+ tools, same workflow.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
  * Windsurf IDE installed ([download here](https://codeium.com/windsurf))
  * An Adspirer account ([free to start](https://adspirer.ai/sign-up))
  * At least one ad platform account: Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, or TikTok Ads
  * Basic familiarity with JSON config files
</Note>

## Setup (3 Minutes)

### Step 1: Add Adspirer to Your MCP Config

Windsurf stores MCP server configs at `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`. Create or edit that file:

```bash theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "adspirer": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

If you already have other MCP servers configured, add the `"adspirer"` entry to the `"mcpServers"` object. The `"type": "streamable-http"` is important -- it tells Windsurf to use HTTP transport with real-time progress streaming.

### Step 2: Restart Windsurf

MCP configs load on startup. Close Windsurf completely and reopen it.

### Step 3: Authenticate

Open Windsurf's AI chat (default hotkey: Cmd+Shift+I or Ctrl+Shift+I) and say:

```
Check my connected ad platforms
```

Windsurf will prompt you to authorize Adspirer. Your browser opens automatically for OAuth 2.1 sign-in. Connect your ad accounts (Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads) and approve permissions.

### Step 4: Verify the Connection

After authenticating, Windsurf should show you a table of your connected accounts with names, IDs, and connection status. If you see your ad platforms listed, you're ready to go.

## What You Can Do

100+ tools across 4 ad platforms, accessible from Windsurf's AI chat:

| Platform         | Tools | Key Capabilities                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Google Ads**   | 39    | Keyword research, Search & PMax campaigns, wasted spend detection, budget optimization, search term reports |
| **LinkedIn Ads** | 28    | B2B targeting (job titles, industries, company size), sponsored content, lead gen forms, creative analysis  |
| **Meta Ads**     | 20    | Image/video/carousel ads, audience targeting, creative fatigue detection, placement optimization            |
| **TikTok Ads**   | 4     | In-feed campaigns, asset validation, performance tracking                                                   |

Plus 8 automation tools for scheduling, monitoring, and cross-platform reporting.

## Example Prompts

What to ask Windsurf once you're connected:

### Google Search Campaign

```
Create a Google Search campaign for my fitness app:
- Product: personal training app with AI workout plans, $14.99/mo
- Target: fitness enthusiasts aged 25-45
- Budget: $60/day
- Research keywords with CPC data first
- Include negative keywords for free workout searches
```

### Google PMax Campaign

```
Set up a PMax campaign for my online store:
- Product: handmade ceramic mugs, $34 average order
- Target ROAS: 400%
- Product images: [paste URLs]
- Write 5 headlines and 4 descriptions
- Connect to my Merchant Center feed
```

### Meta Ads Campaign

```
Launch a Meta video campaign for my meal prep service:
- Target: busy professionals aged 28-42, interests in healthy eating and meal planning
- Budget: $45/day
- Video URL: [paste URL]
- Write 3 primary text variations
- Optimize for sign-ups
```

### LinkedIn Ads Campaign

```
Create a LinkedIn campaign for my HR tech startup:
- Product: AI-powered applicant tracking system
- Target: HR Directors and Talent Acquisition VPs
- Company size: 500-10,000 employees
- Budget: $100/day
- Goal: demo requests
- Image URL: [paste URL]
```

### Wasted Spend Audit

```
Audit all my ad accounts for the last 30 days:
- Google: keywords with spend but zero conversions
- Meta: ads with frequency > 4 and declining CTR
- LinkedIn: audience segments with CPA above $80

Prioritize actions by potential monthly savings.
```

## Agent Skills (Coming Soon)

<Note>
  **Note:** Windsurf skills support is currently in development.

  Skills are instruction files that teach AI assistants the optimal workflow for using Adspirer's 100+ tools -- which tools to call first, how to validate data before creating campaigns, when to ask for user confirmation, etc. Other clients ([Claude Code](/ai-clients/claude-code), [Cursor](/ai-clients/cursor), [OpenClaw](/ai-clients/openclaw)) already have skills available. Windsurf support will be added to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/amekala/ads-mcp) soon.
</Note>

For now, Windsurf has full access to all 100+ Adspirer tools. You just need to be more explicit in your prompts about the workflow you want -- for example, "research keywords before suggesting a campaign" instead of assuming the AI will know to do that automatically.

## Safety Features

* **All campaigns created PAUSED:** Review before they spend money
* **User confirmation prompts:** Windsurf asks before actions that affect spend
* **OAuth 2.1 with PKCE:** No passwords or API keys stored locally
* **Connection verification:** Tools check that you're managing the correct account

## Troubleshooting

### Windsurf doesn't recognize Adspirer tools

Check your MCP config file:

```bash theme={null}
cat ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json
```

Make sure the JSON is valid (no trailing commas, proper quotes). Verify the `"type"` is set to `"streamable-http"`. Restart Windsurf after any config changes.

### "Connection failed" error

Your firewall or network might be blocking the MCP connection. Try:

* Whitelisting `mcp.adspirer.com` in your firewall
* Checking if your company VPN blocks external HTTP connections
* Testing with a different network to isolate the issue

### OAuth flow not opening in browser

Some browser settings block automatic redirects. Try:

* Manually visiting [adspirer.ai](https://adspirer.ai) and signing in first
* Checking your default browser settings (Windsurf uses your system default)
* Disabling browser extensions that block pop-ups

### Tools returning errors or "limit exceeded"

Check your account status at [adspirer.ai](https://adspirer.ai). Free accounts get 10 tool calls/month. If you've hit the limit, upgrade to Plus ($25/mo for 50 calls) or Pro ($75/mo for 100 calls).

### Config file doesn't exist

If `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` doesn't exist, create the directory structure first:

```bash theme={null}
mkdir -p ~/.codeium/windsurf
echo '{"mcpServers":{"adspirer":{"type":"streamable-http","url":"https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp"}}}' > ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json
```

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Windsurf and Cursor?">
    Both are AI-powered code editors with MCP support. [Cursor](/ai-clients/cursor) is built on VS Code and has mature Cursor Rules support. Windsurf is built by Codeium with a different AI model and UX. Choose based on which editor you prefer -- both work equally well with Adspirer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Windsurf Flow mode with Adspirer?">
    Yes. Windsurf Flow (the multi-step agentic mode) has full access to Adspirer tools. You can ask Flow to analyze campaigns, generate reports, and save the output as files in your project -- all in one autonomous task.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will skills be available for Windsurf?">
    Yes. Skills support is in development and will be added to the [ads-mcp GitHub repo](https://github.com/amekala/ads-mcp) soon. Follow the repo for updates.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I manage multiple ad accounts?">
    Yes. Connect multiple Google Ads accounts, multiple Meta Business Managers, etc. Use the `switch_primary_account` tool to change which account you're managing, or specify the account ID in your prompts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does Adspirer cost?">
    Pricing is based on tool calls, not ad spend. Free tier: 10 calls/month. Plus: $25/mo for 50 calls. Pro: $75/mo for 100 calls. See [full pricing details](https://www.adspirer.com/pricing).

# AI Advertising: The Complete Guide to Agentic Marketing in 2025
Source: https://www.adspirer.com/docs/guides/ai-advertising

Learn how AI advertising works with ChatGPT and Claude. Discover agentic marketing strategies to automate Google Ads, TikTok Ads, and Meta Ads in 2025.

Transform your ad management with AI-powered automation

## What is AI Advertising?

AI advertising refers to using artificial intelligence—specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude—to manage, optimize, and automate advertising campaigns across platforms like Google Ads, Meta Ads, and TikTok Ads.

Instead of manually clicking through complex dashboards, marketers can now use natural language to instruct AI agents to perform tasks like:

* **Campaign Creation**: "Launch a Performance Max campaign targeting US customers with a \$100/day budget"
* **Budget Optimization**: "Pause all campaigns with ROAS below 2.0"
* **Reporting**: "Show me my top 10 performing ads this week"
* **Keyword Management**: "Add negative keywords for all irrelevant search terms"

This shift from dashboard-based management to conversational AI is called **Agentic Advertising**.

## How Agentic Advertising Works

Agentic advertising connects AI assistants directly to advertising platform APIs through tools like Adspirer's MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.

**The Traditional Way:**

1. Log into Google Ads dashboard
2. Navigate through multiple screens
3. Click dozens of buttons
4. Wait for loading screens
5. Repeat for each platform

**The Agentic Way:**

1. Open ChatGPT or Claude
2. Describe what you want in plain English
3. AI executes the task via API
4. Review and approve changes

The AI agent understands your intent and translates it into the exact API calls needed to accomplish your goal. It's like having a junior media buyer who never gets tired and can work across all platforms simultaneously.

## Benefits of AI-Powered Ad Management

**Speed**: Tasks that took 30 minutes now take 30 seconds

**Scale**: Manage 50 accounts as easily as 5

**Consistency**: No more human errors in campaign setup

**24/7 Monitoring**: AI agents can watch for anomalies around the clock

**Cross-Platform Efficiency**: Single conversation to manage Google, Meta, and TikTok

**Data-Driven Decisions**: AI can analyze thousands of data points to make recommendations

## Getting Started with Adspirer

Adspirer provides the MCP server that connects your AI assistant to advertising platforms. Here's how to get started:

1. **Connect Your AI**: Install Adspirer in ChatGPT or Claude
2. **Link Your Ad Accounts**: Authorize access to Google Ads, TikTok Ads, or Meta Ads
3. **Start Conversing**: Ask your AI to perform tasks in natural language

No coding required. No complex setup. Just connect and start managing your ads through conversation.

Learn how to automate Google Ads with scripts, rules, and AI tools. Step-by-step guide with examples and best practices for 2025.

Stop clicking. Start automating. The complete guide to Google Ads automation.

## What is Google Ads Automation?

Google Ads automation refers to using technology—whether native platform features, scripts, third-party tools, or AI—to handle repetitive tasks and optimize campaigns without manual intervention.

In 2025, automation has evolved beyond simple rules. Today's options include:

**Native Automation:**

* Automated bidding strategies (Target CPA, Maximize Conversions)
* Dynamic Search Ads that generate headlines automatically
* Performance Max campaigns with AI-driven optimization
* Responsive Search Ads with automatic asset optimization

**Scripts & Rules:**

* Google Ads Scripts (JavaScript-based automation)
* Automated rules for budget and bid adjustments
* Custom alerts and notifications

**AI-Powered Automation:**

* MCP integrations with ChatGPT and Claude
* Natural language campaign management

The key is choosing the right level of automation for your needs—from simple rules to fully AI-driven management.

Create conditions-based automations in the Google Ads interface:

* Pause keywords with high cost and low conversions
* Increase budgets on high-performing campaigns

## Google Ads Scripts: Advanced Automation

For advertisers who need more control, Google Ads Scripts offer powerful JavaScript-based automation.

**Script Resources:**

* Can be complex to debug
* Execution time limits apply

## AI-Powered Google Ads Automation

The newest frontier in Google Ads automation is AI-powered management through tools like Adspirer.

**How AI Automation Works:**

Instead of writing scripts or clicking through interfaces, you simply describe what you want in natural language:

* "Create a Search campaign for plumbing services in Chicago with a \$50/day budget"
* "Pause all keywords with CPA above \$100"
* "Show me campaigns where impressions dropped more than 20% week over week"

The AI understands your intent and executes the appropriate Google Ads API calls.

**Advantages of AI Automation:**

1. **No Coding Required**: Natural language replaces JavaScript
2. **Cross-Platform**: Same conversation can manage Google, Meta, and TikTok
3. **Intelligent Analysis**: AI can analyze data and provide recommendations
4. **Faster Execution**: Complex tasks completed in seconds
5. **Always Available**: Works 24/7 across time zones

**Getting Started with AI Automation:**

1. Connect your Google Ads account to Adspirer
2. Add the MCP connector to ChatGPT or Claude
3. Start managing campaigns through conversation

Try asking: "Research keywords for \[your business] and show me estimated CPCs"

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the best way to automate Google Ads?">

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can AI fully automate Google Ads management?">

# Google Ads Keyword Research with ChatGPT Apps: Complete 2026 Guide
Source: https://www.adspirer.com/docs/guides/chatgpt-google-ads-keywords

Master Google Ads keyword research with ChatGPT Apps in 2026. Get real Keyword Planner data, dynamic intent classification, and budget recommendations through conversation.

Research keywords through conversation—not spreadsheets

## Key Takeaways

* ChatGPT Apps can connect directly to Google Ads Keyword Planner for real-time keyword data
* Dynamic CPC thresholds automatically adapt to your industry (legal keywords at $50 CPC vs. retail at $2)
* High-intent keywords are identified using percentile-based analysis, not arbitrary thresholds
* Budget recommendations are calculated from actual keyword data, not guesswork
* You can research, analyze, and select keywords entirely through conversation

## What is Keyword Research with ChatGPT Apps?

Keyword research has traditionally required logging into multiple tools, exporting spreadsheets, and manually analyzing data. With ChatGPT Apps—OpenAI's name for connected AI tools—you can now research Google Ads keywords through natural conversation.

A ChatGPT App for Google Ads connects directly to your account and Google's Keyword Planner API. Instead of navigating complex interfaces, you describe what you're looking for, and the AI returns organized, actionable keyword data.

**Why this matters for advertisers:**

* **Speed**: Research that took 2 hours now takes 10 minutes
* **Context**: The AI understands your business and adjusts recommendations accordingly
* **Accuracy**: Real Google Keyword Planner data, not estimated third-party numbers
* **Actionability**: Keywords are automatically grouped by commercial intent

This is part of a broader shift toward [AI-powered advertising](/guides/ai-advertising) where natural language replaces complex dashboards.

</Tip>

## How Keyword Research Works with ChatGPT Apps

When you ask a ChatGPT App to research keywords, here's what happens behind the scenes:

**1. Seed Keyword Extraction**

The AI analyzes your request and extracts seed keywords. If you say "I run a solar panel installation company in Phoenix," it identifies seeds like:

* solar panel installation
* solar panels phoenix
* residential solar
* solar energy installation

**2. Keyword Planner API Query**

The app queries Google's Keyword Planner with your seeds and target location. This returns:

* Monthly search volume
* Low and high top-of-page bid estimates
* Competition level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
* Related keyword suggestions

**3. Dynamic Intent Classification**

Here's where it gets interesting. Rather than using fixed CPC thresholds (\$3 = high intent), the app calculates **dynamic thresholds** based on your actual keyword set:

| Intent Level | Threshold                 | Logic                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| HIGH         | ≥75th percentile CPC      | Top 25% most expensive keywords = highest commercial value |
| MEDIUM       | 25th-75th percentile      | Middle 50%                                                 |
| LOW          | Less than 25th percentile | Bottom 25%, lower commercial intent                        |

**Why this matters:** A "high intent" keyword in the legal industry might have a $150 CPC, while in retail it's $3. Fixed thresholds don't work across industries—percentile-based classification does.

**4. Quality Filtering**

Before presenting results, the app filters out garbage:

* Keywords with duplicate words ("solar solar panels")
* Nonsensical patterns ("panel panels")
* Keywords with fewer than 100 monthly searches
* Connector-only phrases ("and solar", "the panels")

**5. Budget Recommendations**

Finally, the app calculates budget recommendations based on your selected keywords:

| Budget Tier  | Formula                     | Use Case                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Conservative | Median CPC × 50 clicks/day  | Safe starting budget     |
| Moderate     | Average CPC × 50 clicks/day | Balanced approach        |
| Aggressive   | Max CPC × 50 clicks/day     | Compete for all keywords |

1. After signing in, you'll see the **onboarding wizard**
2. Click **Connect Google Ads** (or Meta Ads, TikTok Ads)
3. Sign in with your Google account and authorize access
4. Select the specific ad account you want to manage
5. Repeat for any additional platforms you want to connect

**Why connect here first?** This one-time setup securely links your ad accounts to Adspirer. Once connected, any AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude) can access them without re-authenticating.

See our [Google Ads integration guide](https://www.adspirer.com/integrations/google-ads) for detailed setup instructions.

**Step 3: Open ChatGPT and Find Adspirer**

Now that your accounts are connected, add Adspirer to ChatGPT:

1. Open [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)
2. Go to **Settings → Apps** (or use the App search)
3. Search for **"Adspirer"**
4. Click **Connect**

**Step 4: Authorize the Connection**

When you connect, ChatGPT will ask you to authorize Adspirer:

1. Click the authorization link
2. Sign in with your **Adspirer account** (the one you created in Step 1)
3. Approve the connection

Since you already connected Google Ads in Step 2, your ad account is immediately available—no additional setup needed.

Alternatively, you can use Adspirer with [Claude](https://www.adspirer.com/integrations/claude) via MCP.

**Step 5: Describe Your Business and Goals**

Start with a natural description of what you're advertising:

**Example Prompt:**

```
I run a plumbing company in Austin, Texas. We specialize in emergency
repairs and water heater installation. I want to find keywords for a
Google Ads search campaign with a $100/day budget.
```

The AI will:

* Extract seed keywords (emergency plumber, water heater installation, etc.)
* Set location targeting to Austin, TX
* Note your budget constraint

## Review and Refine Keyword Results

**Step 6: Review Initial Keyword Results**

The app returns organized results with:

* Total keywords found
* Recommended keywords for campaign
* Dynamic CPC analysis with location-specific data
* HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW intent keyword groupings
* Monthly searches, CPC ranges, and competition levels

**Step 7: Refine Your Keywords**

Ask follow-up questions to refine results:

* "Show me only keywords with 500+ monthly searches"
* "Remove any keywords mentioning 'cheap' or 'free'"
* "Add more keywords related to tankless water heaters"
* "What negative keywords should I add based on these results?"

**Step 8: Get Budget Recommendations**

The app calculates budgets based on your selected keywords across three tiers:

* **Conservative**: Based on median CPC, safe starting budget
* **Moderate**: Based on average CPC, balanced approach
* **Aggressive**: Compete for all high-intent keywords

**Step 9: Create Your Campaign (Optional)**

Once satisfied, you can ask Adspirer to create the campaign directly:
"Create a Google Ads search campaign using these keywords. Name it 'Austin Plumbing - Emergency Services' with a \$75/day budget."

See our guide on [Google Ads automation](/guides/google-ads-automation) for more campaign creation workflows.

## Best Practices for ChatGPT Keyword Research

**Do's**

**Be Specific About Location**
Google Ads CPCs vary dramatically by location. "Plumber" in New York costs 3x more than in rural Texas. Always specify your target geography.

**Include Budget Context**
Mentioning your budget helps the AI prioritize realistic keywords. A $50/day budget shouldn't target $30 CPC keywords.

**Ask for Negative Keywords**
Every keyword research session should include negative keyword discovery. Ask explicitly—the AI won't always surface them unprompted.

**Request Multiple Intent Levels**
Don't just ask for "high intent" keywords. A healthy campaign includes a mix of intent levels for different funnel stages.

**Don'ts**

**Don't Ignore Low-Volume Keywords**
Keywords with 50-200 searches/month can be highly profitable with low competition. Don't filter them out automatically.

**Don't Trust Volume Alone**
High search volume doesn't equal high value. A 10,000 search keyword with \$0.50 CPC might be mostly informational traffic.

**Don't Skip Quality Score Factors**
When selecting keywords, consider whether you can write relevant ads and have relevant landing pages. Keywords you can't support well will have poor Quality Scores.

**Don't Forget Mobile vs. Desktop**
Some keywords cost 50-100% more on mobile. If your site isn't mobile-optimized, consider device bid adjustments from the start.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How accurate is keyword data from ChatGPT Apps?">
    When connected to Google Ads, ChatGPT Apps pull data directly from Google Keyword Planner—the same source agencies use. The data is as accurate as Google provides. However, CPCs shown are estimates; actual costs depend on Quality Score, competition, and ad rank.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I research keywords without a Google Ads account?">
    You need an active Google Ads account with billing set up to access Keyword Planner data. Google requires this for accurate data. If you don't have an account yet, create one at ads.google.com first.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is this different from using Keyword Planner directly?">
    The main differences are: Conversation (describe what you want in natural language), Analysis (automatic intent classification and budget recommendations), Filtering (built-in quality filtering removes garbage keywords), and Speed (no clicking through interfaces—just ask and receive).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many keywords should I target per campaign?">
    Start with 15-25 high-intent keywords per ad group. The ChatGPT App typically recommends the top 20 keywords based on intent and volume. You can always expand later based on performance data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does this work for Display or YouTube campaigns?">
    Keyword research through ChatGPT Apps is primarily designed for Search campaigns. Display and YouTube use different targeting methods (audiences, placements) where keyword research is less central.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use this with Claude instead of ChatGPT?">
    Yes! Adspirer works with both ChatGPT and Claude. See our Claude integration guide for setup instructions.

Google Ads (formerly known as Google AdWords) is powerful but complex. Whether you're running Search campaigns, Display ads, or Performance Max, managing campaigns manually means:

* Hours spent navigating the dashboard
* Repetitive tasks like bid adjustments
* Human errors in campaign setup
* Delayed responses to performance changes
* Difficulty scaling across multiple accounts

Automation solves these problems by letting machines handle the routine work while you focus on strategy. For advertisers who remember the AdWords days, the platform has become significantly more complex—making automation not just helpful, but essential.

**The ROI of Google Ads Automation:**

* Save 10-20 hours per week on campaign management
* Reduce setup errors by 90%
* React to performance changes in real-time
* Scale to more clients without adding headcount
* Maintain consistency across all campaigns and accounts

## Types of Google Ads Automation

**1. Native Google Automation**
Google provides built-in automation features that require no external tools:

* Smart Bidding (Target CPA, Target ROAS, Maximize Conversions)
* Performance Max campaigns with AI-driven optimization
* Responsive Search Ads with automatic headline testing
* Automated rules for budget and status changes
* Dynamic Search Ads for automatic keyword targeting

**2. Google Ads Scripts (AdWords Scripts)**
JavaScript-based automation that runs inside Google Ads:

* Custom reporting and data exports
* Bulk changes across campaigns
* Weather-based or inventory-linked bidding
* Cross-account automation for agencies
* Requires JavaScript coding knowledge

**3. Third-Party Automation Tools**
External platforms offering pre-built automation:

* Optmyzr, WordStream, Adalysis
* Pre-built automation recipes and templates
* Dashboard-based interface
* Monthly subscription costs typically \$100-500+

**4. AI Agent Automation (Adspirer)**
The newest and most powerful approach:

* Natural language commands via ChatGPT and Claude
* No coding required whatsoever
* Cross-platform capability (Google, TikTok, Meta)
* Real-time API integration
* Approval workflows for safe execution

## Key Areas to Automate in Google Ads

**Campaign Creation & Setup**
Launch new campaigns from templates or by describing your goals in plain language. Whether it's a Search campaign, Performance Max, or Display campaign—automation ensures consistent setup every time.

**Bid Management & Optimization**
Automatically adjust bids based on performance metrics, time of day, device type, or custom rules. AI-powered bidding goes beyond Google's native options by considering your business context.

**Negative Keyword Management**
Continuously scan search terms and add negative keywords to prevent wasted spend. This alone can save thousands in ad spend monthly for active accounts.

**Budget Management & Pacing**
Shift budget between campaigns based on performance and pacing. Ensure you never underspend or overspend on any given day or campaign.

**Performance Reporting**
Generate and send reports automatically on a schedule. Pull data from multiple accounts into unified dashboards without manual data entry.

**Anomaly Detection & Alerts**
Get notified immediately when metrics fall outside acceptable ranges. Catch issues before they waste significant budget.

**Search Term Analysis**
Automatically review search queries to find new keyword opportunities and wasteful terms—a task that takes hours manually.

## Enterprise Google Ads Automation

Enterprise advertisers face unique challenges that require sophisticated automation solutions. Managing millions in ad spend across hundreds of campaigns demands more than basic scripts.

**Enterprise Automation Requirements:**

1. **Multi-Account Management (MCC Automation)**
   * Bulk changes across 50+ accounts simultaneously
   * Standardized campaign structures and naming conventions
   * Unified reporting across the entire portfolio
   * Role-based access and approval workflows

2. **Advanced Bidding Strategies**
   * Portfolio bid strategies across account groups
   * Custom algorithmic bidding based on business KPIs
   * Margin-based or profit-based optimization
   * Cross-channel budget allocation

3. **Integration with Business Systems**
   * CRM integration for lead quality feedback
   * Inventory management system connections
   * Revenue tracking beyond last-click attribution
   * Real-time pricing and availability updates

4. **Compliance & Governance**
   * Audit trails for all automated changes
   * Approval hierarchies for budget modifications
   * Brand safety monitoring and enforcement
   * Automated policy compliance checking

**Enterprise Automation with AI:**

Adspirer enables enterprise teams to manage complex Google Ads operations through natural language. Instead of building custom integrations or managing complex script libraries, teams can:

* "Show me all accounts with ROAS below 2.0 this month"
* "Pause all campaigns with daily spend above \$1000 and zero conversions"
* "Create a report comparing Performance Max vs Search across all client accounts"

This democratizes access to powerful automation—no engineering team required.

## Google Ads Automation Services

For businesses that want automation without the DIY approach, several service models exist:

**Managed Automation Services:**
Agencies and consultants who implement and manage automation on your behalf:

* Audit existing accounts for automation opportunities
* Build custom scripts or rule sets
* Monitor automated systems for issues
* Continuous optimization and refinement

**Automation-as-a-Service Platforms:**
SaaS tools that provide automation without requiring manual setup:

* Pre-built automation recipes
* Template libraries for common use cases
* Ongoing platform updates and maintenance
* Support and training included

**AI-Powered Automation (The Modern Approach):**
Tools like Adspirer that leverage AI for intuitive automation:

* No setup required—connect and start automating
* Natural language interface anyone can use
* Continuous improvement through AI updates
* Flexible enough for any use case

**Choosing the Right Service Model:**

| Factor           | Managed Services | SaaS Platforms | AI Automation |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Setup Time       | Weeks            | Days           | Minutes       |
| Technical Skills | None             | Low            | None          |
| Customization    | High             | Medium         | High          |
| Monthly Cost     | \$\$\$\$         | \$\$-\$\$\$    | \$            |
| Flexibility      | Medium           | Low            | High          |

For most advertisers, AI-powered automation like Adspirer offers the best balance of power, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. You get enterprise-grade automation capabilities without enterprise-grade complexity or pricing.

## Migrating from AdWords to Modern Automation

If you've been managing Google Ads (or AdWords, as it was previously known) for years, transitioning to modern automation can feel daunting. Here's how to make the switch:

**Phase 1: Assessment (Week 1)**

* Document current manual processes and time spent
* Identify repetitive tasks that consume the most time
* List critical workflows that can't be interrupted
* Map current script or rule dependencies

**Phase 2: Foundation (Week 2)**

* Enable automated bidding on suitable campaigns
* Set up basic automated rules as a safety net
* Connect to AI automation tools like Adspirer
* Establish baseline metrics for comparison

**Phase 3: Migration (Weeks 3-4)**

* Replace manual bid management with AI assistance
* Automate negative keyword workflows
* Set up automated reporting
* Train team on new natural language interfaces

**Phase 4: Optimization (Ongoing)**

* Monitor automated performance vs. historical
* Refine automation rules based on results
* Expand automation to additional use cases
* Document best practices for the team

**Common Migration Challenges:**

1. **Trust Issues**: "Will automation make mistakes?"
   * Solution: Use approval workflows and start small

2. **Knowledge Loss**: "We have years of expertise in our scripts"
   * Solution: AI can learn your patterns through conversation

3. **Integration Concerns**: "Our current tools work well"
   * Solution: AI automation complements existing tools

The goal isn't to automate everything immediately—it's to gradually reduce manual work while maintaining or improving results.

## Getting Started with AI-Powered Google Ads Automation

Adspirer makes Google Ads automation accessible to everyone—from solo advertisers to enterprise teams. Here's how to get started:

# Marketing Agency Automation: Scale Your Agency with AI in 2025
Source: https://www.adspirer.com/docs/guides/marketing-agency-automation

Discover how marketing agencies scale with AI automation. Learn to manage more clients, reduce overhead, and improve campaign performance with Adspirer.

Serve 10x more clients without 10x the headcount

## The Agency Scaling Problem

Every agency hits a wall. You can only hire so many people, train them so fast, and bill so many hours. Traditional agency scaling means:

**Linear Growth**: 2x clients = 2x staff = 2x overhead
**Training Burden**: New hires take months to become productive
**Quality Variance**: Different team members deliver different results
**Margin Pressure**: More clients means more management overhead

AI automation breaks this linear relationship. With the right tools, one strategist can manage what previously required a team.

## What Agencies Can Automate

**Campaign Management**

* Launch campaigns across platforms from templates
* Bulk changes across multiple client accounts
* Standardized naming conventions and settings

**Optimization**

* Automated bid adjustments based on performance
* Negative keyword management at scale
* Budget pacing and reallocation

**Reporting**

* Auto-generated client reports
* Cross-platform performance aggregation
* Anomaly detection and alerts

**Client Communication**

* Performance summaries on demand
* Quick answers to client questions
* Proactive optimization recommendations

**Quality Assurance**

* Campaign audit checklists
* Consistency verification
* Error detection before launch

## The AI-Powered Agency Model

The agencies winning in 2025 are structured differently:

**Traditional Model:**

* Account Managers manually execute
* Limited by hours in the day
* Inconsistent execution quality
* High operational overhead

**AI-Augmented Model:**

* Strategists direct AI agents
* Execution happens instantly
* Consistent, error-free setup
* Dramatically lower overhead

**Team Structure Evolution:**

* Fewer junior executors
* More strategic advisors
* AI handles routine tasks
* Humans handle relationships and strategy

This doesn't mean fewer jobs---it means different jobs. The agency of 2025 employs strategists who orchestrate AI, not button-clickers who navigate dashboards.

## Getting Started: Agency Automation Roadmap

**Phase 1: Connect & Consolidate**

* Connect all client accounts to Adspirer
* Establish standard operating procedures
* Train team on AI-assisted workflows

**Phase 2: Automate Routine Tasks**

* Start with reporting and monitoring
* Add negative keyword automation
* Implement bid management rules

**Phase 3: Scale Operations**

* Launch campaigns via AI
* Cross-platform management
* Proactive optimization suggestions

**Phase 4: Productize Services**

* Package AI-powered services
* Premium automation offerings
* Competitive differentiation

Start small, prove value, then expand. Most agencies see ROI within the first month of implementation.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will AI replace agency jobs?">
    AI changes jobs, not eliminates them. Routine execution tasks will be automated, but strategic thinking, client relationships, and creative direction still require humans. The best agencies will use AI to enhance their team's capabilities.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many clients can one person manage with AI?">
    It depends on complexity, but agencies report managing 3-5x more clients per team member when using AI automation for routine tasks like reporting, bid management, and negative keyword optimization.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is AI reliable enough for client work?">
    When used correctly, yes. Adspirer includes approval workflows so you review changes before they're applied. The AI suggests, humans approve. This maintains quality while saving time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do clients feel about AI-managed campaigns?">
    Most clients care about results, not methods. When AI improves performance and enables faster service, clients are happy. Be transparent about your tools---it can be a competitive advantage.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the ROI of agency automation?">
    Agencies typically see ROI within 30 days through time savings alone. The bigger win is capacity---serving more clients with the same team. Some agencies report 50%+ margin improvements.

Reach billions of engaged users with TikTok advertising

## Why Advertise on TikTok?

TikTok has over 1 billion monthly active users and is the fastest-growing social platform. Here's why advertisers are flocking to TikTok:

**Engagement**: Users spend an average of 95 minutes per day on TikTok
**Discovery**: The algorithm surfaces content to interested users regardless of follower count
**Demographics**: While Gen Z dominates, 36% of users are now 35+
**Intent**: TikTok search is becoming a product discovery engine
**Cost**: CPMs are often lower than Meta and Google for similar audiences

TikTok isn't just for dance videos anymore---it's a serious advertising platform that can drive real business results.

## TikTok Ad Formats

**In-Feed Ads**
Native video ads that appear in the For You feed. The most common format for performance advertisers.

**TopView Ads**
Premium placement that appears when users first open the app. Great for brand awareness.

**Spark Ads**
Boost organic TikTok posts (yours or creators') as ads. High authenticity and engagement.

**Branded Hashtag Challenges**
Encourage user-generated content around your brand. Best for large-scale awareness campaigns.

**Branded Effects**
Custom filters and effects users can add to their videos. Interactive brand engagement.

**Shopping Ads**
Product catalog integration for e-commerce. Drive direct purchases from the platform.

## TikTok Creative Best Practices

TikTok ads that perform look native to the platform. Here's what works:

**Hook in 3 Seconds**: Capture attention immediately---users scroll fast
**Vertical Video**: Always 9:16 aspect ratio, full-screen experience
**Sound On**: TikTok is a sound-on platform---music and voiceovers matter
**Authenticity**: Polished ads often underperform raw, genuine content
**Trends**: Incorporate trending sounds, formats, and hashtags
**CTAs**: Clear calls to action, but integrated naturally
**Creator-Style**: User-generated content often outperforms brand-produced ads

The TikTok mantra: "Don't make ads, make TikToks."

## Automating TikTok Ads with AI

Managing TikTok Ads alongside Google and Meta can be overwhelming. AI automation helps by:

**Unified Management**: Control all platforms from one conversation
**Creative Testing**: Quickly launch multiple ad variations
**Budget Optimization**: Shift spend to best-performing ads automatically
**Reporting**: Get cross-platform performance summaries instantly

With Adspirer, you can manage TikTok Ads using natural language:

* "Show me my TikTok campaign performance this week"

* "Pause all TikTok ads with CTR below 0.5%"

No more switching between dashboards---manage everything through your AI assistant.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What type of businesses should advertise on TikTok?">
    TikTok works well for D2C e-commerce, apps, entertainment, beauty, fashion, food & beverage, and any business targeting consumers under 45. B2B can work but requires more creative adaptation.
