# TikTok Ads Integration

Reach TikTok's billion-plus users with AI-powered campaign management. Create In-Feed video ads, validate creative assets, and track performance with 4 specialized tools.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
- TikTok Ads Manager account ([create one here](https://ads.tiktok.com))
- A TikTok Business Center account with billing enabled
- Admin access to the ad account you want to manage
- Adspirer account connected via [Claude Code](/ai-clients/claude-code), [Cursor](/ai-clients/cursor), or any [supported AI client](https://www.adspirer.com/integrations)
</Note>

## Connecting TikTok Ads

Once you've set up Adspirer with your AI client, connect TikTok:

1. Open your AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Claude Code, etc.)
2. Say: "Connect my TikTok Ads account"
3. Adspirer opens your browser for OAuth authorization
4. Sign in to TikTok Business Center and select the ad account you want to manage
5. Approve permissions (read campaign data, create ads, manage budgets)

Verify the connection:

```
Check my connected ad platforms
```

You should see your TikTok ad account listed with advertiser name, account ID, and active status.

## What You Can Do (4 Tools)

### Performance Analysis

- `get_tiktok_campaign_performance` -- Pull metrics for TikTok campaigns (video views, engagement, conversions, cost metrics)

### Creative Management

- `discover_tiktok_assets` -- Check existing video creatives in your TikTok account
- `validate_and_prepare_tiktok_assets` -- Verify video files meet TikTok's requirements (9:16 vertical, 5-60 seconds, MP4/MOV)

### Campaign Creation

- `create_tiktok_campaign` -- Launch In-Feed video campaigns (created PAUSED)

<Tip>
TikTok Ads is Adspirer's newest integration with a focused tool set. Additional tools for audience targeting, budget optimization, and ad group management are on the roadmap. The current 4 tools cover the core workflow: check assets, validate creatives, create campaigns, and track performance.
</Tip>

## Campaign Creation Workflow

TikTok campaigns follow a streamlined 4-step workflow:

```
1. get_connections_status
   -> (verify TikTok Ads is connected)
2. discover_tiktok_assets
   -> (check existing videos in your account)
3. validate_and_prepare_tiktok_assets
   -> (verify video meets TikTok requirements: 9:16 vertical, 5-60 seconds)
4. create_tiktok_campaign
   -> (campaign created PAUSED -- you review before launching)
```

## Creative Assets: What You Need to Know

TikTok is a video-first platform. All campaigns require video creative.

<Warning>
Adspirer does NOT generate videos. You provide video URLs from Google Drive, Dropbox, S3, or any publicly accessible link. The `validate_and_prepare_tiktok_assets` tool checks that your video meets TikTok's specifications before campaign creation.
</Warning>

### TikTok's Creative Requirements

The `validate_and_prepare_tiktok_assets` tool checks these automatically:

- **Aspect ratio:** 9:16 (vertical) -- 1080x1920px recommended
- **Duration:** 5-60 seconds (9-15 seconds performs best for engagement)
- **Format:** MP4 or MOV
- **File size:** Under 500MB
- **Resolution:** Minimum 720p (1280x720px), 1080p recommended

### Supported Asset Sources

- Google Drive (public or shared links)
- Dropbox (public links)
- Amazon S3 (public URLs)
- Any publicly accessible video URL

### Creative Best Practices

- **Hook in the first 2 seconds:** TikTok users scroll fast. Grab attention immediately.
- **Native look and feel:** Ads that look like organic TikTok content outperform polished commercials
- **Vertical video only:** Horizontal or square videos perform significantly worse on TikTok
- **Sound on:** Unlike other platforms, most TikTok users watch with sound on. Use music and voiceover.
- **Short and punchy:** 9-15 seconds is the sweet spot for In-Feed ads

## Ad Format: In-Feed Ads

TikTok In-Feed ads appear in users' For You feed and blend with organic content. They support:

- **Traffic objective:** Drive users to your website or landing page
- **Conversions objective:** Optimize for specific actions (purchases, signups, add to cart)
- **App installs:** Drive mobile app downloads

In-Feed ads auto-play with sound as users scroll through their feed. Users can like, comment, share, and follow directly from the ad.

## Targeting Options

When creating TikTok campaigns through Adspirer, you can target by:

### Demographics

- **Age:** 13-17, 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55+
- **Gender:** Male, Female, All
- **Location:** Country, state/region, city-level targeting

### Interests & Behaviors

- **Interests:** Beauty, Fashion, Food & Beverage, Technology, Fitness, Gaming, and 20+ categories
- **Behavioral signals:** Video interaction patterns, content engagement history
- **Device:** iOS, Android, specific device models

## Budget Guidelines

- **Minimum:** $20/day per campaign (TikTok's requirement for campaign-level budgets)
- **Ad group minimum:** $20/day
- **Recommended:** $50+/day for meaningful data collection
- **Testing:** Start with $50/day on a single ad group to gauge performance before scaling
- **CPC range:** Expect $0.50-2.00 per click (varies by industry and targeting)
- **CPM range:** $6-10 per thousand impressions

## Best Use Cases for TikTok Ads

- **E-commerce:** Products that photograph/film well (fashion, beauty, gadgets, food)
- **Brand awareness:** Reaching younger demographics (Gen Z and Millennials) at scale
- **Product launches:** New product reveals with authentic, native-feeling video content
- **App installs:** Mobile-first audience with high app download intent
- **Direct-to-consumer brands:** Brands that can create authentic, engaging short-form video

**Not ideal for:** B2B lead generation (use [LinkedIn Ads](/ad-platforms/linkedin-ads)), high-intent search capture (use [Google Ads](/ad-platforms/google-ads)), audiences over 45 (limited reach on TikTok).

## Troubleshooting

### "Ad account not connected" error

Re-authenticate your TikTok Business Center account:

```
Connect my TikTok Ads account
```

Make sure you select the correct advertiser account during OAuth. If you manage multiple accounts in TikTok Business Center, you may need to reconnect and select the right one.

### "Asset validation failed" error

Common causes:

- Video is not in 9:16 vertical format (horizontal or square videos are rejected)
- Video duration is outside 5-60 second range
- File too large (over 500MB)
- Unsupported format (use MP4 or MOV)
- Video URL is private or not publicly accessible

Run validation separately to diagnose:

```
Validate this TikTok video creative: [your URL]
```

### "Campaign creation failed" error

Most common reason: skipping the asset validation step. TikTok campaigns require `validate_and_prepare_tiktok_assets` before `create_tiktok_campaign`. The validation tool uploads and processes the video in TikTok's system.

If you're using [agent skills](/agent-skills/overview), the AI enforces the correct workflow automatically.

### Low video completion rates

Your creative may not be engaging enough for TikTok's audience. Common fixes:

- Stronger hook in the first 2 seconds
- Use trending sounds or music
- Make it feel organic, not like a traditional ad
- Shorter duration (try 9-12 seconds instead of 30+)
- Test multiple video variations to find what resonates

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I create image ads on TikTok through Adspirer?">
Not currently. TikTok is a video-first platform, and Adspirer supports In-Feed video ads. While TikTok does support some image-based formats (like Spark Ads), the current integration focuses on video campaigns. Image ad support may be added in the future based on TikTok's API capabilities.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Adspirer generate TikTok video content?">
No. Adspirer manages campaigns, not video production. You create videos using your preferred tools (CapCut, Canva, Adobe Premiere, or even your phone) and provide the video URL. For AI-generated video, tools like Runway, Pika, or HeyGen can help. Upload the result to Google Drive or Dropbox and provide the link to Adspirer.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between TikTok Ads and Meta Ads?">
**TikTok Ads:** Video-first platform with a younger audience (Gen Z, Millennials). Content feels native and authentic. Strong for brand discovery and impulse purchases. Lower CPM but requires video creative.

**[Meta Ads](/ad-platforms/meta-ads):** Supports image, video, and carousel formats. Broader age demographics. More advanced targeting and retargeting options. Better for retargeting and full-funnel campaigns.

Many advertisers run both: TikTok for awareness and discovery, Meta for retargeting and conversion optimization.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I boost existing TikTok organic posts?">
Not through Adspirer currently. Boosting organic posts (Spark Ads) requires additional API permissions. The current integration creates new In-Feed ads with your uploaded video creatives. Spark Ads support is being evaluated for a future release.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How much does Adspirer cost for TikTok Ads?">
Adspirer pricing is based on tool calls, not ad spend. Free tier: 10 calls/month. Plus: $25/mo for 50 calls. Pro: $75/mo for 100 calls. A typical TikTok campaign creation uses 3-4 tool calls. See [full pricing](https://www.adspirer.com/pricing?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_content=pricing).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is my TikTok advertising data secure?">
Yes. Adspirer uses OAuth 2.1 authentication -- your TikTok credentials are never stored on Adspirer's servers. All connections are HTTPS-encrypted with strict security protocols. You can revoke access at any time from your TikTok Business Center.
