B2B advertising done right. Target decision-makers by job title, industry, and seniority with 28 specialized tools.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
- LinkedIn Campaign Manager account ([create one here](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/ads))
- A LinkedIn company page (required to run ads)
- An active ad account with billing information
- Admin access to the ad account you want to manage
- Adspirer account connected via [Claude Code](/ai-clients/claude-code), [Cursor](/ai-clients/cursor), or any [supported AI client](https://www.adspirer.com/integrations)
</Note>

## Connecting LinkedIn Ads

Once you've set up Adspirer with your AI client, connect LinkedIn:

1. Open your AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Claude Code, etc.)
2. Say: "Connect my LinkedIn Ads account"
3. Adspirer opens your browser for OAuth authorization
4. Sign in to LinkedIn Campaign Manager and select the ad account you want to manage
5. Approve permissions (read campaign data, create ads, manage budgets)

Verify the connection:

```
Check my connected ad platforms
```

You should see your LinkedIn ad account listed with organization name, account ID, and active status.

## B2B Targeting Options

LinkedIn's targeting is the most precise for B2B. Here's what you can target:

### Job Criteria

- **Job titles:** CMO, VP Marketing, Marketing Manager, Growth Lead, etc.
- **Job functions:** Marketing, Sales, Engineering, Operations, etc.
- **Seniority:** C-level, VP, Director, Manager, Entry-level
- **Years of experience:** 0-2, 3-5, 6-10, 11+ years

### Company Criteria

- **Industries:** Computer Software, Financial Services, Marketing & Advertising, etc. (140+ options)
- **Company size:** 1-10, 11-50, 51-200, 201-500, 501-1000, 1001-5000, 5001-10000, 10001+ employees
- **Company name:** Target specific companies (ABM campaigns)
- **Company growth rate:** Fast-growing companies (20%+ headcount growth)

### Skills & Interests

- **Skills:** SaaS, Marketing Automation, SEO, Content Marketing, etc.
- **Groups:** Target members of specific LinkedIn groups
- **Interests:** Categories professionals engage with

## Budget Guidelines

- **Minimum:** $10/day (LinkedIn's requirement)
- **Recommended:** $50+/day for meaningful B2B lead volume
- **Testing:** Start with $75/day split across 2-3 audience segments
- **CPC range:** Expect $8-15+ per click (higher than Meta/Google but higher quality leads)
- **Cost per lead:** B2B leads typically $40-150 depending on industry and targeting

## Creative Requirements

LinkedIn sponsored content uses single images. The `validate_and_prepare_linkedin_assets` tool checks:

- **Dimensions:** 1200x627px (1.91:1 aspect ratio) or 1200x1200px (1:1)
- **Format:** JPG or PNG
- **File size:** Under 5MB
- **Text:** Intro text up to 600 characters (150 shown before "see more")
- **Headline:** Up to 200 characters
- **Call-to-action:** Learn More, Download, Sign Up, Register, Apply, etc.

## Best Use Cases for LinkedIn Ads

- **B2B lead generation:** Demos, webinar signups, whitepaper downloads
- **Account-based marketing (ABM):** Target specific companies or job titles
- **Thought leadership:** Content promotion to build brand authority
- **Event promotion:** Conferences, trade shows, virtual events
- **Recruitment:** Job postings to specific professional audiences

**Not ideal for:** E-commerce, consumer products, impulse purchases. LinkedIn is a B2B platform. CPC is high, but lead quality is excellent for long sales cycles.

## Troubleshooting

### "No organizations found" error

You need a LinkedIn company page before you can run ads. Create one at [linkedin.com/company/setup/new](https://www.linkedin.com/company/setup/new), then reconnect your LinkedIn Ads account in Adspirer.

### "Campaign creation failed" error

Most common reason: skipping `get_linkedin_organizations`. You must select an organization before creating campaigns. Run the full workflow in order.

If you're using [agent skills](/agent-skills/overview), the AI enforces the correct workflow automatically.

### "Audience too small" warning

LinkedIn requires a minimum audience size of 300 members. If your targeting is too narrow (e.g., "CMOs at Series A SaaS startups in San Francisco"), broaden it:

- Expand job titles (CMO, VP Marketing, Head of Marketing)
- Widen geography (San Francisco -> Bay Area -> California)
- Increase company size range (Series A -> Series A-C)

### High CPC but low conversions

Common issue with LinkedIn. Your targeting might be too broad. Tighten it:

- Add seniority filters (target decision-makers, not individual contributors)
- Use negative targeting (exclude students, job seekers)
- Test different creative (professional, data-driven imagery works best on LinkedIn)
- Optimize your landing page for B2B (short forms, clear value prop, no fluff)

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I run video ads on LinkedIn through Adspirer?">
Not yet. Adspirer currently supports image-based sponsored content only. Video ad support is on the roadmap for Q2 2026.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I target by company revenue?">
LinkedIn doesn't expose revenue as a targeting option via the API. You can target by company size (employee count) and industry as a proxy.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between LinkedIn and Google Ads for B2B?">
**LinkedIn:** Best for demand generation (reaching people who might need your solution but aren't actively searching). Target by job title/seniority. Higher CPC but better B2B lead quality.

**[Google Ads](/ad-platforms/google-ads):** Best for demand capture (reaching people actively searching for solutions like yours). Target by keywords. Lower CPC but broader intent.

Most B2B companies run both: Google for high-intent keywords, LinkedIn for cold outreach to specific job titles.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use LinkedIn's Matched Audiences (retargeting)?">
Not through Adspirer yet. Matched Audiences (website retargeting, contact list uploads) requires additional API permissions that are in development. For now, focus on interest-based and job title targeting.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How much does Adspirer cost for LinkedIn Ads?">
Adspirer pricing is based on tool calls, not ad spend. Free tier: 15 calls/month. Plus: $49/mo for 150 calls. Pro: $99/mo for 600 calls. Max: $199/mo for 3,000 calls. A typical LinkedIn campaign creation uses 5-6 tool calls. See [full pricing](https://www.adspirer.com/pricing?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_content=pricing).
