Once you've set up Adspirer with your AI client, connect Google Ads:

1. Open your AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Claude Code, etc.)
2. Say: "Connect my Google Ads account"
3. Adspirer opens your browser for OAuth authorization

Verify the connection:

```
Check my connected ad platforms
```

You should see your Google Ads account listed with account name, customer ID, and active status.

## Campaign Types

### Google Search Campaigns

Text ads that appear when people search specific keywords on Google. Best for capturing high-intent traffic -- people actively looking for your product or service.

**When to use:** Lead generation, e-commerce, local services, SaaS signups.

### Performance Max (PMax) Campaigns

AI-powered campaigns that show ads across all Google channels: Search, Display, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, and Discover. Google's algorithm automatically optimizes placement and creative combinations.

**When to use:** E-commerce (especially with product feeds), broad awareness + conversions, when you have strong creative assets (images + video).

## Search Campaign Creation Workflow

Google Search campaigns follow a 5-step workflow. Skip steps and the campaign will fail validation.

```
1. get_connections_status
   -> (verify Google Ads is connected)
2. research_keywords
   -> (input: business description, seed keywords, target location)
   -> (output: keyword suggestions with real CPC data)
3. discover_existing_assets
   -> (check if you have headlines/descriptions in Google Ads already)
4. suggest_ad_content (if new assets needed)
   -> (generate headlines and descriptions within Google's character limits)
5. validate_and_prepare_assets
   -> (verify everything meets Google's requirements)
6. create_search_campaign
   -> (campaign created PAUSED -- you review before launching)
```

## PMax Campaign Creation Workflow

Performance Max requires more creative assets than Search. Four-step workflow:

```
1. get_connections_status
   -> (verify Google Ads is connected)
2. discover_existing_assets
   -> (check for images, videos, logos in your account)
3. help_user_upload (if assets are missing)
   -> (guide you to upload to Google or provide URLs)
4. validate_and_prepare_assets
   -> (PMax requires: 5+ images, 1+ video, 5+ headlines, 5+ descriptions)
5. create_pmax_campaign
   -> (campaign created PAUSED)
```

### PMax Asset Requirements

- **Images:** Minimum 5 (1200x628px landscape + 1200x1200px square)
- **Video:** Minimum 1 (under 30 seconds recommended)
- **Headlines:** 5 (max 30 characters each)
- **Descriptions:** 5 (max 90 characters each)
- **Logo:** 1 (1200x1200px)

## Keyword Research: What You Need to Know

The `research_keywords` tool connects directly to Google Keyword Planner data. You get:

- **Search volume:** Monthly search estimates for each keyword
- **CPC data:** Average cost-per-click and estimated bid range
- **Competition level:** Low, Medium, or High
- **Keyword suggestions:** Related keywords you may not have considered

<Warning>
Keyword research is a Read tool (no cost impact), but always review the data before committing budget. High-volume keywords are not always the best choice -- look for keywords with good volume AND manageable CPC relative to your target CPA.
</Warning>

## Ad Copy Guidelines

The `suggest_ad_content` tool generates headlines and descriptions within Google's strict character limits:

- **Headlines:** Up to 15 headlines, max 30 characters each
- **Descriptions:** Up to 4 descriptions, max 90 characters each
- **Display URL paths:** 2 paths, max 15 characters each

Google dynamically combines your headlines and descriptions. Provide diverse options so Google's algorithm can find high-performing combinations.

## Budget Guidelines

- **Minimum:** $10/day per campaign (Google's practical minimum for Search)
- **Recommended:** $30+/day for meaningful data collection
- **Testing:** Start with $40/day split across 3-5 ad groups to test different keyword themes
- **Scaling:** Once you find keywords with CPA below target, increase budget 20-30% every 5-7 days
- **PMax minimum:** $20+/day recommended (PMax needs budget to test across multiple channels)

## Best Use Cases for Google Ads

- **Demand capture:** Reach people actively searching for your product or service (highest intent of any platform)
- **Local services:** Plumbers, dentists, lawyers, restaurants -- people searching "near me"
- **E-commerce:** Product searches, comparison shopping, brand searches
- **SaaS & B2B:** High-intent keywords like "CRM software" or "marketing automation tool"
- **Lead generation:** Contact forms, phone calls, demo requests from search traffic

**Not ideal for:** Brand awareness (use [Meta Ads](/ad-platforms/meta-ads) or [TikTok Ads](/ad-platforms/tiktok-ads) instead), visual/video-first products, targeting by job title (use [LinkedIn Ads](/ad-platforms/linkedin-ads)).

## Troubleshooting

### "Ad account not connected" error

Re-authenticate your Google Ads account:

```
Connect my Google Ads account
```

Make sure you select the correct Google account and ad account during OAuth. If you manage multiple accounts (MCC), you may need to specify which sub-account to use.

### "Asset validation failed" error

Common causes:

- Headlines exceed 30 characters or descriptions exceed 90 characters
- Fewer than 5 images for PMax campaigns
- Image dimensions do not meet minimum requirements
- Missing required asset types (PMax needs images, headlines, descriptions, and at least one logo)

Run validation separately to diagnose:

```
Validate my Google Ads assets for a Search campaign
```

### "Campaign creation failed" error

Most common reason: skipping workflow steps. Google campaigns require keyword research and asset validation before creation. If you jump straight to `create_search_campaign` without running `research_keywords` and `validate_and_prepare_assets` first, it will fail.

If you're using [agent skills](/agent-skills/overview), the AI enforces the correct workflow automatically.

### "Keyword research returned no results"

This usually means your seed keywords or business description is too narrow. Try:

- Broader seed keywords (e.g., "plumber" instead of "emergency residential copper pipe repair")
- Different location targeting (e.g., expand from city to state)
- More descriptive business description so the tool can suggest related terms

### High CPA with no conversions

Common issue with new campaigns. Troubleshoot:

- Review search terms with `analyze_search_terms` -- are irrelevant queries consuming budget?
- Add negative keywords with `add_negative_keywords` to block wasteful clicks
- Check landing page quality -- Google Ads can drive clicks but conversions depend on your website
- Use `analyze_wasted_spend` to identify keywords spending without converting

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's the difference between Search and Performance Max campaigns?">
**Search campaigns** show text ads on Google Search results when people search specific keywords. You control which keywords trigger your ads. Best for high-intent traffic.

**Performance Max campaigns** use Google's AI to show ads across all Google channels (Search, Display, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Discover). You provide creative assets and a conversion goal, and Google optimizes everything automatically. Best when you have strong creative assets and want broad reach with automated optimization.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Adspirer generate images or videos for Google Ads?">
No. Adspirer generates ad copy (headlines and descriptions) through the `suggest_ad_content` tool, but it does not create images or videos. For PMax campaigns, you provide image/video URLs from Google Drive, Dropbox, S3, or any public URL. The `validate_and_prepare_assets` tool ensures your assets meet Google's specifications.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I manage Google Ads and Meta Ads from the same conversation?">
Yes. Adspirer supports multi-platform management. You can pull Google Ads performance, then switch to Meta Ads analysis in the same conversation. Use `get_connections_status` to see all connected platforms.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between Google Ads and Meta Ads?">
**[Google Ads](/ad-platforms/google-ads):** Best for demand capture (reaching people actively searching for solutions). Keyword-based targeting. Higher intent but more expensive clicks.

**[Meta Ads](/ad-platforms/meta-ads):** Best for demand generation (reaching people who don't know you exist) and visual products. Interest-based targeting. Lower intent but cheaper clicks.

Most advertisers run both: Google for high-intent searches, Meta for awareness and retargeting.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How much does Adspirer cost for Google Ads?">
Adspirer pricing is based on tool calls, not ad spend. Free tier: 10 calls/month. Plus: $25/mo for 50 calls. Pro: $75/mo for 100 calls. A typical Google Search campaign creation uses 5-6 tool calls. Keyword research alone is 1 call. See [full pricing](https://www.adspirer.com/pricing?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_content=pricing).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is my Google Ads data secure?">
Yes. Adspirer uses OAuth 2.1 authentication -- your Google Ads credentials are never stored on Adspirer's servers. All connections are HTTPS-encrypted with least-privilege access scopes. You can revoke access at any time from your Google account settings.
