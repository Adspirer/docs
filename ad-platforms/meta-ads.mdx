## Prerequisites

<Note>
- Meta Business Manager account ([create one here](https://business.facebook.com))
- An active Meta ad account with billing information
- Admin access to the ad account you want to manage
- Adspirer account connected via [Claude Code](/ai-clients/claude-code), [Cursor](/ai-clients/cursor), or any [supported AI client](https://www.adspirer.com/integrations)
</Note>

## Connecting Meta Ads

Once you've set up Adspirer with your AI client, connect Meta:

1. Open your AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Claude Code, etc.)
2. Say: "Connect my Meta Ads account"
3. Adspirer opens your browser for OAuth authorization
4. Sign in to Meta Business Manager and select the ad account you want to manage
5. Approve permissions (read campaign data, create ads, manage budgets)

Verify the connection:

```
Check my connected ad platforms
```

You should see your Meta ad account listed with account name, ID, and active status.

## Campaign Creation Workflow

Meta campaigns follow a 6-step workflow. Skip steps and the campaign will fail validation.

```
1. get_connections_status
   ↓ (verify you're managing the right Meta account)
2. search_meta_targeting
   ↓ (find your target audience)
3. select_meta_campaign_type
   ↓ (image, video, or carousel?)
4. discover_meta_assets
   ↓ (check existing creatives)
5. validate_and_prepare_meta_assets
   ↓ (verify asset URLs meet Meta requirements)
6. create_meta_*_campaign
   ↓ (image/video/carousel — campaign created PAUSED)
```

## Creative Assets: What You Need to Know

Adspirer does NOT generate images or videos. You provide the creative URLs.

### Supported Asset Sources

- Google Drive (public or shared links)
- Dropbox (public links)
- Amazon S3 (public URLs)
- Any publicly accessible image/video URL

### Meta's Creative Requirements

The `validate_and_prepare_meta_assets` tool checks these automatically:

- **Image ads:** 1080x1080px minimum, JPG or PNG, under 30MB, 1:1 or 4:5 aspect ratio
- **Video ads:** 1080x1080px minimum, MP4 or MOV, under 4GB, 1:1 or 4:5 or 9:16 aspect ratio, 1-240 seconds
- **Carousel ads:** 2-10 cards, each 1080x1080px, JPG or PNG
- **Text limits:** Primary text 125 chars (recommended), headline 27 chars, description 30 chars

## Budget Guidelines

- **Minimum:** $5/day per ad set (Meta's requirement)
- **Recommended:** $20+/day for meaningful data
- **Testing:** Start with $30/day split across 2-3 ad sets to find winners
- **Scaling:** Once you find ROAS above 3.0, increase budget 20-30% every 3 days

## Best Use Cases for Meta Ads

- **E-commerce:** Visual products (fashion, home goods, beauty)
- **Demand generation:** Reach cold audiences with interest-based targeting
- **Retargeting:** Re-engage website visitors, cart abandoners
- **Video storytelling:** Brand awareness campaigns with Reels or Stories
- **Lead generation:** On-platform forms (though LinkedIn often performs better for B2B)

## Troubleshooting

### "Ad account not connected" error

Re-authenticate your Meta Business Manager:

```
Connect my Meta Ads account
```

Make sure you select the correct ad account during OAuth. If you manage multiple accounts, you may need to reconnect with admin permissions.

### "Asset validation failed" error

Common causes:

- Image/video URL is private (not publicly accessible)
- Wrong dimensions (Meta requires minimum 1080x1080px)
- File too large (30MB for images, 4GB for video)
- Unsupported format (use JPG/PNG for images, MP4/MOV for video)

Run validation separately to diagnose:

```
Validate this Meta creative: [your URL]
```

### "Campaign creation failed" error

Most common reason: skipping workflow steps. Meta campaigns require all 6 steps in order. If you jump straight to `create_meta_image_campaign` without running `validate_and_prepare_meta_assets` first, it will fail.

If you're using [agent skills](/agent-skills/overview), the AI enforces the correct workflow automatically.

### Creative fatigue detection not working

The tool needs at least 14 days of data per ad. If your ads are newer, it can't detect fatigue yet. Wait until ads have run for 2+ weeks.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I manage Instagram ads separately from Facebook?">
    No. Meta treats Facebook and Instagram as placement options within the same campaign. When you create a Meta campaign through Adspirer, you choose placements (Feed, Stories, Reels, etc.) that span both platforms. You can't create Instagram-only campaigns through the API.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does Adspirer generate ad creatives?">
    No. Adspirer manages campaigns, not creative production. You provide image/video URLs. For AI-generated creatives, use tools like Midjourney, DALL-E, or Runway, then upload to Google Drive/Dropbox and provide the link.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I A/B test creatives?">
    Yes. Create multiple ad sets with different creatives (different image URLs) but the same targeting and budget. After 7 days, use `analyze_meta_ad_performance` to see which creative wins, then pause the losers and scale the winner.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Meta and Google Ads?">
    **Meta Ads:** Best for demand generation (reaching people who don't know you exist) and visual products. Interest-based targeting. Lower intent but cheaper clicks.

    **[Google Ads](/ad-platforms/google-ads):** Best for demand capture (reaching people actively searching for solutions). Keyword-based targeting. Higher intent but more expensive clicks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How much does Adspirer cost for Meta Ads?">
    Adspirer pricing is based on tool calls, not ad spend. Free tier: 10 calls/month. Plus: $25/mo for 50 calls. Pro: $75/mo for 100 calls. A typical Meta campaign creation uses 4-6 tool calls. See [full pricing](https://www.adspirer.com/pricing).
