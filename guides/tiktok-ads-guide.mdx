Reach billions of engaged users with TikTok advertising

## Why Advertise on TikTok?

TikTok has over 1 billion monthly active users and is the fastest-growing social platform. Here's why advertisers are flocking to TikTok:

**Engagement**: Users spend an average of 95 minutes per day on TikTok
**Discovery**: The algorithm surfaces content to interested users regardless of follower count
**Demographics**: While Gen Z dominates, 36% of users are now 35+
**Intent**: TikTok search is becoming a product discovery engine
**Cost**: CPMs are often lower than Meta and Google for similar audiences

TikTok isn't just for dance videos anymore---it's a serious advertising platform that can drive real business results.

## TikTok Ad Formats

**In-Feed Ads**
Native video ads that appear in the For You feed. The most common format for performance advertisers.

**TopView Ads**
Premium placement that appears when users first open the app. Great for brand awareness.

**Spark Ads**
Boost organic TikTok posts (yours or creators') as ads. High authenticity and engagement.

**Branded Hashtag Challenges**
Encourage user-generated content around your brand. Best for large-scale awareness campaigns.

**Branded Effects**
Custom filters and effects users can add to their videos. Interactive brand engagement.

**Shopping Ads**
Product catalog integration for e-commerce. Drive direct purchases from the platform.

## TikTok Creative Best Practices

TikTok ads that perform look native to the platform. Here's what works:

**Hook in 3 Seconds**: Capture attention immediately---users scroll fast
**Vertical Video**: Always 9:16 aspect ratio, full-screen experience
**Sound On**: TikTok is a sound-on platform---music and voiceovers matter
**Authenticity**: Polished ads often underperform raw, genuine content
**Trends**: Incorporate trending sounds, formats, and hashtags
**CTAs**: Clear calls to action, but integrated naturally
**Creator-Style**: User-generated content often outperforms brand-produced ads

The TikTok mantra: "Don't make ads, make TikToks."

Managing TikTok Ads alongside Google and Meta can be overwhelming. AI automation helps by:
