## What is Facebook Ads Automation?

Facebook Ads automation uses technology to manage, optimize, and scale your Meta advertising across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and the Audience Network.

Meta has invested heavily in automation, making it central to their advertising platform:

**Native Automation Features:**
- Advantage+ campaigns with AI-driven optimization
- Automated rules for budget and bid management

**External Automation Options:**

**Why Automate Facebook Ads?**

1. **Scale**: Manage more campaigns without proportional time investment
2. **Speed**: React to performance changes instantly
3. **Consistency**: Apply the same logic across all campaigns
4. **Optimization**: Let algorithms find efficiencies 24/7
5. **Cross-Platform**: Manage Facebook and Instagram together

In 2025, the question isn't whether to automate, but how much and what type of automation fits your needs.
