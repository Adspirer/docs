Transform your ad management with AI-powered automation

## What is AI Advertising?

AI advertising refers to using artificial intelligence—specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude—to manage, optimize, and automate advertising campaigns across platforms like Google Ads, Meta Ads, and TikTok Ads.

Instead of manually clicking through complex dashboards, marketers can now use natural language to instruct AI agents to perform tasks like:

- **Campaign Creation**: "Launch a Performance Max campaign targeting US customers with a $100/day budget"
- **Budget Optimization**: "Pause all campaigns with ROAS below 2.0"
- **Reporting**: "Show me my top 10 performing ads this week"
- **Keyword Management**: "Add negative keywords for all irrelevant search terms"

This shift from dashboard-based management to conversational AI is called **Agentic Advertising**.

## How Agentic Advertising Works

Agentic advertising connects AI assistants directly to advertising platform APIs through tools like Adspirer's <Tooltip tip="Model Context Protocol — an open standard for connecting AI assistants to external tools">MCP</Tooltip> server.

**The Traditional Way:**
1. Log into Google Ads dashboard
2. Navigate through multiple screens
3. Click dozens of buttons
4. Wait for loading screens
5. Repeat for each platform

**The Agentic Way:**
1. Open ChatGPT or Claude
2. Describe what you want in plain English
3. AI executes the task via API
4. Review and approve changes

The AI agent understands your intent and translates it into the exact API calls needed to accomplish your goal. It's like having a junior media buyer who never gets tired and can work across all platforms simultaneously.
