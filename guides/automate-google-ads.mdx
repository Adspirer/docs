## Native Google Ads Automation Features

Google provides several built-in automation features that require no coding or external tools:

**Automated Bidding Strategies:**
- **Target CPA**: Sets bids to achieve your target cost per acquisition
- **Target ROAS**: Optimizes for your return on ad spend goal
- **Maximize Conversions**: Gets the most conversions within budget
- **Maximize Conversion Value**: Prioritizes highest-value conversions
- **Enhanced CPC**: Adjusts manual bids based on conversion likelihood

**Performance Max Campaigns:**
Performance Max uses Google's AI to automatically:
- Choose the best placements (Search, Display, YouTube, Gmail, Maps)
- Generate ad combinations from your assets
- Find new audiences
- Optimize bids in real-time

**Responsive Search Ads (RSAs):**
Provide up to 15 headlines and 4 descriptions, and Google's AI tests combinations to find winners.

**Automated Rules:**
Create conditions-based automations in the Google Ads interface:
- Pause keywords with high cost and low conversions
- Increase budgets on high-performing campaigns
- Send email alerts when metrics change

## Google Ads Scripts: Advanced Automation

For advertisers who need more control, Google Ads Scripts offer powerful JavaScript-based automation.

**What Scripts Can Do:**
- Bulk changes across thousands of keywords
- Custom reporting and data exports
- Weather-based bid adjustments
- Inventory-linked campaign management
- Cross-account management for agencies

**Popular Script Use Cases:**

1. **N-gram Analysis**: Find wasted spend on poor search terms
2. **Link Checker**: Pause ads with broken landing pages
3. **Hour of Day Bidding**: Adjust bids by time of day
4. **Quality Score Tracker**: Monitor QS changes over time
5. **Budget Pacing**: Prevent overspend or underspend

**Script Resources:**
- Google Ads Scripts documentation
- Brainlabs script library
- Search Engine Land script collection
- FreeAdWordsScripts.com

**Limitations of Scripts:**
- Requires JavaScript knowledge
- Limited to Google Ads (no cross-platform)
- Can be complex to debug
- Execution time limits apply

## AI-Powered Google Ads Automation

The newest frontier in Google Ads automation is AI-powered management through tools like Adspirer.

**How AI Automation Works:**

Instead of writing scripts or clicking through interfaces, you simply describe what you want in natural language:

- "Create a Search campaign for plumbing services in Chicago with a $50/day budget"
- "Pause all keywords with CPA above $100"
- "Show me campaigns where impressions dropped more than 20% week over week"

The AI understands your intent and executes the appropriate Google Ads API calls.

**Advantages of AI Automation:**

1. **No Coding Required**: Natural language replaces JavaScript
2. **Cross-Platform**: Same conversation can manage Google, Meta, and TikTok
3. **Intelligent Analysis**: AI can analyze data and provide recommendations
4. **Faster Execution**: Complex tasks completed in seconds
5. **Always Available**: Works 24/7 across time zones

**Getting Started with AI Automation:**

1. Connect your Google Ads account to Adspirer
2. Add the MCP connector to ChatGPT or Claude
3. Start managing campaigns through conversation

Try asking: "Research keywords for [your business] and show me estimated CPCs"
