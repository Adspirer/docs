Research keywords through conversation—not spreadsheets

## Key Takeaways

- ChatGPT Apps can connect directly to Google Ads Keyword Planner for real-time keyword data
- Dynamic CPC thresholds automatically adapt to your industry (legal keywords at $50 CPC vs. retail at $2)
- High-intent keywords are identified using percentile-based analysis, not arbitrary thresholds
- Budget recommendations are calculated from actual keyword data, not guesswork
- You can research, analyze, and select keywords entirely through conversation

## What is Keyword Research with ChatGPT Apps?

Keyword research has traditionally required logging into multiple tools, exporting spreadsheets, and manually analyzing data. With ChatGPT Apps—OpenAI's name for connected AI tools—you can now research Google Ads keywords through natural conversation.

A ChatGPT App for Google Ads connects directly to your account and Google's Keyword Planner API. Instead of navigating complex interfaces, you describe what you're looking for, and the AI returns organized, actionable keyword data.

**Why this matters for advertisers:**

- **Speed**: Research that took 2 hours now takes 10 minutes
- **Context**: The AI understands your business and adjusts recommendations accordingly
- **Accuracy**: Real Google Keyword Planner data, not estimated third-party numbers
- **Actionability**: Keywords are automatically grouped by commercial intent

This is part of a broader shift toward [AI-powered advertising](/guides/ai-advertising) where natural language replaces complex dashboards.

## How Keyword Research Works with ChatGPT Apps

When you ask a ChatGPT App to research keywords, here's what happens behind the scenes:

**1. Seed Keyword Extraction**

The AI analyzes your request and extracts seed keywords. If you say "I run a solar panel installation company in Phoenix," it identifies seeds like:
- solar panel installation
- solar panels phoenix
- residential solar
- solar energy installation

**2. Keyword Planner API Query**

The app queries Google's Keyword Planner with your seeds and target location. This returns:
- Monthly search volume
- Low and high top-of-page bid estimates
- Competition level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
- Related keyword suggestions

**3. Dynamic Intent Classification**

Here's where it gets interesting. Rather than using fixed CPC thresholds ($3 = high intent), the app calculates **dynamic thresholds** based on your actual keyword set:

| Intent Level | Threshold | Logic |
|--------------|-----------|-------|
| HIGH | ≥75th percentile CPC | Top 25% most expensive keywords = highest commercial value |
| MEDIUM | 25th-75th percentile | Middle 50% |
| LOW | Less than 25th percentile | Bottom 25%, lower commercial intent |

**Why this matters:** A "high intent" keyword in the legal industry might have a $150 CPC, while in retail it's $3. Fixed thresholds don't work across industries—percentile-based classification does.

**4. Quality Filtering**

Before presenting results, the app filters out garbage:
- Keywords with duplicate words ("solar solar panels")
- Nonsensical patterns ("panel panels")
- Keywords with fewer than 100 monthly searches
- Connector-only phrases ("and solar", "the panels")

**5. Budget Recommendations**

Finally, the app calculates budget recommendations based on your selected keywords:

| Budget Tier | Formula | Use Case |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| Conservative | Median CPC × 50 clicks/day | Safe starting budget |
| Moderate | Average CPC × 50 clicks/day | Balanced approach |
| Aggressive | Max CPC × 50 clicks/day | Compete for all keywords |

**Step 5: Describe Your Business and Goals**

Start with a natural description of what you're advertising:

**Example Prompt:**
```
I run a plumbing company in Austin, Texas. We specialize in emergency
repairs and water heater installation. I want to find keywords for a
Google Ads search campaign with a $100/day budget.
```

The AI will:
- Extract seed keywords (emergency plumber, water heater installation, etc.)
- Set location targeting to Austin, TX
- Note your budget constraint

## Review and Refine Keyword Results

**Step 6: Review Initial Keyword Results**

The app returns organized results with:
- Total keywords found
- Recommended keywords for campaign
- Dynamic CPC analysis with location-specific data
- HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW intent keyword groupings
- Monthly searches, CPC ranges, and competition levels

**Step 7: Refine Your Keywords**

Ask follow-up questions to refine results:
- "Show me only keywords with 500+ monthly searches"
- "Remove any keywords mentioning 'cheap' or 'free'"
- "Add more keywords related to tankless water heaters"
- "What negative keywords should I add based on these results?"

**Step 8: Get Budget Recommendations**

The app calculates budgets based on your selected keywords across three tiers:
- **Conservative**: Based on median CPC, safe starting budget
- **Moderate**: Based on average CPC, balanced approach
- **Aggressive**: Compete for all high-intent keywords

**Step 9: Create Your Campaign (Optional)**

Once satisfied, you can ask Adspirer to create the campaign directly:
"Create a Google Ads search campaign using these keywords. Name it 'Austin Plumbing - Emergency Services' with a $75/day budget."

See our guide on [Google Ads automation](/guides/google-ads-automation) for more campaign creation workflows.

## Best Practices for ChatGPT Keyword Research

**Do's**

**Be Specific About Location**
Google Ads CPCs vary dramatically by location. "Plumber" in New York costs 3x more than in rural Texas. Always specify your target geography.

**Include Budget Context**
Mentioning your budget helps the AI prioritize realistic keywords. A $50/day budget shouldn't target $30 CPC keywords.

**Ask for Negative Keywords**
Every keyword research session should include negative keyword discovery. Ask explicitly—the AI won't always surface them unprompted.

**Request Multiple Intent Levels**
Don't just ask for "high intent" keywords. A healthy campaign includes a mix of intent levels for different funnel stages.

**Don'ts**

**Don't Ignore Low-Volume Keywords**
Keywords with 50-200 searches/month can be highly profitable with low competition. Don't filter them out automatically.

**Don't Trust Volume Alone**
High search volume doesn't equal high value. A 10,000 search keyword with $0.50 CPC might be mostly informational traffic.

**Don't Skip Quality Score Factors**
When selecting keywords, consider whether you can write relevant ads and have relevant landing pages. Keywords you can't support well will have poor Quality Scores.

**Don't Forget Mobile vs. Desktop**
Some keywords cost 50-100% more on mobile. If your site isn't mobile-optimized, consider device bid adjustments from the start.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How accurate is keyword data from ChatGPT Apps?">
When connected to Google Ads, ChatGPT Apps pull data directly from Google Keyword Planner—the same source agencies use. The data is as accurate as Google provides. However, CPCs shown are estimates; actual costs depend on Quality Score, competition, and ad rank.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I research keywords without a Google Ads account?">
You need an active Google Ads account with billing set up to access Keyword Planner data. Google requires this for accurate data. If you don't have an account yet, create one at ads.google.com first.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is this different from using Keyword Planner directly?">
The main differences are: Conversation (describe what you want in natural language), Analysis (automatic intent classification and budget recommendations), Filtering (built-in quality filtering removes garbage keywords), and Speed (no clicking through interfaces—just ask and receive).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How many keywords should I target per campaign?">
Start with 15-25 high-intent keywords per ad group. The ChatGPT App typically recommends the top 20 keywords based on intent and volume. You can always expand later based on performance data.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does this work for Display or YouTube campaigns?">
Keyword research through ChatGPT Apps is primarily designed for Search campaigns. Display and YouTube use different targeting methods (audiences, placements) where keyword research is less central.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use this with Claude instead of ChatGPT?">
Yes! Adspirer works with both ChatGPT and Claude. See our Claude integration guide for setup instructions.
