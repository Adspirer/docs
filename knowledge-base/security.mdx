Adspirer never sees your ad platform passwords. All authentication uses OAuth 2.1 with <Tooltip tip="Proof Key for Code Exchange — prevents authorization code interception attacks">PKCE</Tooltip> — the same standard used by banking apps.

## Authentication: OAuth 2.1 with PKCE

When you connect an ad platform (Google Ads, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok), Adspirer uses **OAuth 2.1 with PKCE** — the same standard used by banking apps and enterprise software.

### What This Means

- **Your passwords stay with Google/Meta/LinkedIn/TikTok.** Adspirer never receives, stores, or transmits your login credentials.
- **PKCE prevents interception.** Every authentication generates a cryptographic proof that only your specific session can complete. Even if someone intercepts the authorization code, they can't use it.
- **Scoped permissions.** You authorize exactly what Adspirer can do — read campaign data, create ads, manage budgets. Nothing more.

### Token Lifecycle

| Token | Lifetime | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Access token | 1 hour | Authorizes tool calls |
| Refresh token | 30 days | Generates new access tokens without re-login |

Tokens are encrypted at rest and automatically refreshed. If a token expires, your AI client prompts you to re-authenticate.

## What Data Adspirer Accesses

**Reads:**
- Campaign names, statuses, budgets
- Performance metrics (spend, conversions, CPA, ROAS, CTR)
- Keywords, ad copy, targeting settings
- Asset metadata (image/video dimensions, file sizes)

**Writes (with your confirmation):**
- Create campaigns (always created PAUSED)
- Update budgets and bids
- Pause or resume campaigns
- Add keywords, ad copy, or extensions

**Never accesses:**
- Your ad platform login credentials
- Billing/payment information (credit cards, bank accounts)
- Personal data beyond what's shown in ad account settings
- Data from other ad accounts you haven't explicitly connected

## Campaign Safety

Every write operation has built-in safety:

- **Campaigns created PAUSED** — You review before any money is spent
- **User confirmation required** — Your AI assistant asks before budget-affecting actions
- **No automatic retries** — If a campaign creation fails, it reports the error instead of retrying
- **Read-before-write** — Research and validation always happen before creation

## Revoking Access

You can disconnect Adspirer at any time:

1. **From Adspirer:** Visit [adspirer.ai](https://adspirer.ai?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_content=account) and disconnect the platform
2. **From the ad platform:** Revoke access in your platform's security settings:
   - Google: [Security Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
   - Meta: [Business Integrations](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=business_tools)
   - LinkedIn: [Permitted Services](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/permitted-services)
   - TikTok: Business Center > Settings > Authorized Partners

Revoking from either side immediately stops all tool access.

## Infrastructure Security

| Layer | Protection |
|-------|-----------|
| **Transport** | HTTPS/TLS encryption for all API calls |
| **Hosting** | Google Cloud Run with auto-scaling and DDoS protection |
| **Sessions** | Redis with auto-expiring keys (1hr TTL) |
| **Tokens** | Encrypted at rest, hashed in database |
| **Logging** | Structured logs exclude sensitive data (tokens, credentials) |

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Is my ad data shared with other users?">
No. Your data is isolated to your Adspirer account. No data is shared between users, used for training, or sold to third parties.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can Adspirer spend money without my approval?">
No. All campaigns are created PAUSED, and budget changes require explicit user confirmation. Even autonomous agents (like Codex) follow this rule.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What happens if Adspirer goes down?">
Your ad campaigns continue running normally — they're managed by Google/Meta/LinkedIn/TikTok, not by Adspirer. You just can't make changes via AI until the service recovers. Downtime does not affect live campaigns.
