Connect multiple ad accounts per platform and switch between them in conversation.

## How It Works

Your Adspirer account can connect to multiple ad accounts on each platform:

- Multiple Google Ads customer IDs
- Multiple Meta Business Manager ad accounts
- Multiple LinkedIn Campaign Manager accounts
- Multiple TikTok Ads Manager accounts

When you first connect, one account per platform is set as **primary** — all tool calls default to that account.

## Switching Accounts

To change which account you're managing:

```
Switch to my Google Ads account 123-456-7890
```

Or use the tool directly:

```
switch_primary_account(platform="google_ads", account_id="1234567890")
```

The switch persists for your current session. All subsequent tool calls target the new account until you switch again.

## For Agencies

If you manage ads for multiple clients:

1. **Connect all client accounts** through OAuth (each client authorizes separately)
2. **Start each session** by confirming which client you're working with:
   ```
   Show me all my connected ad accounts
   ```
3. **Switch to the client** you want to manage:
   ```
   Switch to the Google Ads account for [Client Name]
   ```
4. **Run your workflow** — all tool calls target that client's account

<Tip>
Always verify the active account before creating campaigns. Running `get_connections_status` at the start of each session prevents accidentally modifying the wrong client's campaigns.
</Tip>

## Cross-Account Reports

Pull performance data from multiple accounts in one request:

```
Compare performance across all my Google Ads accounts for the last 30 days.
Show spend, conversions, and CPA for each account.
```

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Is there a limit to how many accounts I can connect?">
No hard limit. Connect as many ad accounts as you manage. Tool call limits apply to your Adspirer plan, not to the number of connected accounts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can different team members manage different accounts?">
Yes, with Claude Team or Enterprise. Each team member authenticates with their own Adspirer account and connects their own set of ad accounts. See the [Claude setup guide](/ai-clients/claude) for details.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does switching accounts cost a tool call?">
No. Account switching is a session operation and does not count against your tool call limit.
