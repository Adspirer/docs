Your Adspirer account works with every supported AI client. Connect once, use everywhere. All clients share the same <Tooltip tip="Model Context Protocol — an open standard for connecting AI assistants to external tools">MCP</Tooltip> connection.

## One Account, Any Client

| AI Client | Type | Best For |
|-----------|------|----------|
| [ChatGPT](/ai-clients/chatgpt) | Chat app | Marketers, non-technical users |
| [Claude](/ai-clients/claude) | Chat app | Best MCP integration, progress streaming |
| [Claude Code](/ai-clients/claude-code) | Terminal | Developers, automation, scripting |
| [Cursor](/ai-clients/cursor) | IDE | Developers who live in their editor |
| [Codex](/ai-clients/codex) | Autonomous agent | Scheduled tasks, daily monitoring |
| [OpenClaw](/ai-clients/openclaw) | CLI agent | Pre-configured advertising agent |
| [Windsurf](/ai-clients/windsurf) | IDE | Codeium users |
| [Custom GPT](/ai-clients/custom-gpt) | ChatGPT Store | Zero setup, mobile-friendly |

All clients connect to the same MCP server (`mcp.adspirer.com/mcp`) and share your tool call quota.

## Key Differences

### ChatGPT vs Claude

Both work well. Claude has deeper MCP integration (Anthropic created MCP) with progress streaming during long operations. ChatGPT may need more explicit tool mentions in prompts.

### Chat Apps vs Developer Tools

**Chat apps** (ChatGPT, Claude) are conversational — you describe what you want in natural language. No configuration files.

**Developer tools** (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenClaw, Windsurf) support **agent skills** — instruction files that teach the AI optimal advertising workflows. Skills enforce safety rules automatically and improve tool invocation accuracy.

### Interactive vs Autonomous

**Interactive** (all except Codex): You ask, the AI responds. Real-time conversation.

**Autonomous** (Codex): You define a task and schedule. The agent runs it without you being present — e.g., daily performance checks at 8 AM.

## Shared Tool Call Limit

Your monthly tool call limit applies across **all** clients. If your Plus plan has 50 calls/month:

- 10 calls from ChatGPT + 20 from Claude + 20 from Cursor = 50 total
- Switching clients doesn't reset your limit

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Do I need separate Adspirer accounts for each AI client?">
No. One Adspirer account works across all clients. Your ad platform connections persist across all of them.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use different AI clients for different tasks?">
Yes, and this is recommended. Use Claude for quick ad-hoc queries, Cursor for deep analysis sessions, and Codex for scheduled daily monitoring.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What if I switch AI clients mid-workflow?">
Your ad platform connections persist. But workflow state (like "I was in the middle of creating a campaign") doesn't carry between clients. Start a new workflow in the new client.
