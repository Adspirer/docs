## When to Use Each Platform

### Google Ads — Demand Capture

Use Google when people are **actively searching** for what you sell. Someone typing "project management software for remote teams" has high purchase intent.

**Best for:** SaaS, professional services, e-commerce with search demand, local businesses
**Strengths:** Highest intent traffic, keyword targeting, Performance Max for broad reach
**Weakness:** Expensive for competitive keywords ($5-50+ per click in some industries)

### Meta Ads — Demand Generation

Use Meta when you need to **reach people who don't know you exist**. Visual products and impulse purchases perform well.

**Best for:** E-commerce, D2C brands, app installs, local businesses, event promotion
**Strengths:** Cheapest clicks, best visual targeting, massive reach (3B+ users), retargeting
**Weakness:** Lower intent — people are browsing, not buying

### LinkedIn Ads — B2B Lead Generation

Use LinkedIn when your buyers are **business decision-makers**. The only platform where you can target by job title, company size, and seniority.

**Best for:** B2B SaaS, enterprise sales, recruiting, professional services, events
**Strengths:** Unmatched B2B targeting, professional context, lead gen forms
**Weakness:** Most expensive CPC ($5-12+), smaller audience pool

### TikTok Ads — Brand Awareness

Use TikTok for **video-first campaigns** targeting younger demographics. Native-feeling content outperforms polished ads.

**Best for:** Consumer brands, fashion, food, entertainment, app installs
**Strengths:** Lowest CPMs, high engagement, viral potential
**Weakness:** Video required, younger skew, limited targeting precision

## Multi-Platform Strategy

Most advertisers run 2-3 platforms. Common combinations:

| Strategy | Platforms | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| **B2B SaaS** | Google + LinkedIn | Capture search demand + reach decision-makers |
| **E-commerce** | Google + Meta | Capture search demand + generate new demand |
| **Consumer app** | Meta + TikTok | Visual discovery + viral reach |
| **Full funnel** | Google + Meta + LinkedIn | Search capture + visual discovery + B2B targeting |
