Adspirer pricing is based on **tool calls**, not ad spend. Every time your AI assistant calls an Adspirer tool (like pulling performance data or creating a campaign), it counts as one tool call.

## Plans

| Plan | Tool Calls/Month | Monthly | Annual | Best For |
|------|-----------------|---------|--------|----------|
| <Badge>Free Forever</Badge> | 15 | $0 | — | Testing and evaluation |
| <Badge color="blue">Plus</Badge> | 150 | $49/mo | $485/yr | Individual advertisers, small accounts |
| <Badge color="purple">Pro</Badge> | 600 | $99/mo | $999/yr | Agencies, multi-platform advertisers |
| <Badge color="yellow">Max</Badge> | 3,000 | $199/mo | $2,000/yr | High-volume workflows, priority support |

## How Tool Calls Work

Each tool invocation counts as 1 call, regardless of:

- Which platform (Google, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok)
- Which AI client (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc.)
- How much data is returned
- How long the operation takes

### Typical Usage by Task

| Task | Tool Calls | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Check connected platforms | 1 | `get_connections_status` |
| Pull campaign performance | 1 | Per platform |
| Keyword research | 1 | Returns full keyword list with CPC data |
| Create Google Search campaign | 5-6 | Research + assets + validate + create |
| Create Meta image campaign | 4-6 | Targeting + type + assets + validate + create |
| Create LinkedIn campaign | 5-6 | Org + targeting + assets + validate + create |
| Create TikTok campaign | 3-4 | Assets + validate + create |
| Cross-platform performance report | 4-5 | 1 call per connected platform + analysis |
| Wasted spend analysis | 1-2 | Analysis + optional optimization |
| Budget optimization | 2-3 | Performance pull + <Tooltip tip="Return on Ad Spend">ROAS</Tooltip>/<Tooltip tip="Cost Per Acquisition">CPA</Tooltip> recommendation |

### Monthly Usage Examples

| Scenario | Estimated Calls | Recommended Plan |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Weekly performance check (1 platform) | 4-5/mo | Free |
| Weekly check + 1 campaign/month | 10-15/mo | Free or Plus |
| Daily monitoring (2 platforms) | 40-60/mo | Plus |
| Agency managing 3 clients | 60-150/mo | Plus or Pro |
| Heavy usage: daily + campaigns + audits | 150-600/mo | Pro |
| Agency, multi-client, high-volume | 600+/mo | Max |

## What Counts as a Tool Call

**Counts:** Any tool invocation through MCP — `get_campaign_performance`, `research_keywords`, `create_search_campaign`, etc.

**Does NOT count:**
- Connecting your AI client to Adspirer
- OAuth authentication / login
- Viewing your account status
- AI assistant thinking / reasoning between tool calls
- Failed tool calls due to authentication errors

## Checking Your Usage

Ask your AI assistant:

```
Check my Adspirer usage status
```

This returns your current plan, calls used this month, and calls remaining.

## Upgrading

If you hit your limit mid-month, upgrade takes effect immediately and resets your counter. Visit [adspirer.ai](https://adspirer.ai?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_content=account) to manage your plan.
