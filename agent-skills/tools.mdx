## Tool Call Best Practices

<Note>
- **Always start with `get_connections_status`:** Verify the correct ad account is active before using platform-specific tools
- **Chain Read tools before Write tools:** Research, validate, then create. Never jump straight to campaign creation.
- **Ask for user confirmation before Write tools:** Present the plan, get approval, then execute.
- **Never retry Write tools on error:** If a campaign creation fails, report the error and wait for user input. Don't auto-retry.
- **Format results as tables:** Performance data should be scannable (columns: metric, value, change vs. previous period)
</Note>
