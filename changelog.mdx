<Update label="February 22, 2025" description="v1.3.1" tags={["Documentation", "Navigation"]}>

## Resend-Style Navigation

Redesigned the sidebar and top navigation to match Resend's clean layout:

- **Icon tabs in sidebar** — Documentation, Guides, and Knowledge Base now have distinct icons (`book-open`, `compass`, `lightbulb`) for quick visual scanning
- **Knowledge Base promoted** — Moved from a group inside Documentation to its own top-level sidebar tab
- **Navbar redesign** — `Search ⌘K | Sign In | [Book Meeting] | 🌙` matching Resend's clean top bar with dark/light mode toggle

</Update>
