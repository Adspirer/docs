---

Manage all your ad campaigns from the terminal. One command to connect, 100+ tools to use.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
- Claude Code installed:
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```
- An Adspirer account ([free to start](https://adspirer.ai/sign-up))
- At least one ad platform account: Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, or TikTok Ads
- macOS or Linux (Windows requires WSL)
</Note>

## Setup (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Add the Adspirer MCP Server

One command. That's the entire setup:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http adspirer https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp
```

This tells Claude Code where to find Adspirer's 100+ advertising tools. The connection uses streamable HTTP transport for real-time progress updates.

### Step 2: Authenticate

Next time you ask Claude Code about your ad accounts, it'll prompt you to sign in. Your browser opens automatically for OAuth 2.1 authorization -- no passwords stored, no API keys to manage.

You'll see:

```
Adspirer requires authorization. Opening browser...
```

Sign in, connect your ad platforms (Google, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok), and you're done.

### Step 3: Install Agent Skills (Optional But Recommended)

Skills are instruction files that teach Claude the *right way* to use Adspirer's tools. Without skills, Claude sees 100+ tools and has to guess which order to call them. With skills, it follows proven workflows -- research keywords before creating campaigns, validate assets before launching, always confirm before spending money.

Install skills:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amekala/ads-mcp.git /tmp/ads-mcp
cp -r /tmp/ads-mcp/plugins/claude/adspirer/skills/ad-campaign-management ~/.claude/skills/
```

That's it. Claude now knows to check connections first, research before creating, and present results in readable tables.

### Step 4: Verify Your Setup

Run a test prompt:

```
Check my connected ad platforms
```

You should see a table showing your connected accounts across Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and TikTok Ads -- along with account IDs, names, and connection status.

## What You Can Do

100+ tools across 4 ad platforms. Here's what matters:

| Platform | Tools | Key Capabilities |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| **Google Ads** | 39 | Keyword research with real CPC data, Search & PMax campaigns, wasted spend analysis, budget optimization, ad extensions, asset management |
| **LinkedIn Ads** | 28 | Sponsored content, lead gen forms, B2B targeting (job titles, industries, seniority), creative performance analysis |
| **Meta Ads** | 20 | Image/video/carousel campaigns, audience targeting, creative fatigue detection, placement optimization |
| **TikTok Ads** | 4 | In-feed campaigns, asset validation, performance analysis |

Plus 8 automation tools: scheduled briefs, performance monitors, cross-platform reports.

## Example Prompts

What to actually say once you're set up:

### Google Search Campaign

```
Create a Google Ads search campaign for my SaaS product:
- Product: project management tool for remote teams
- Target: team leads and ops managers at companies with 20-200 employees
- Budget: $60/day
- Research keywords with real CPC data first
- Group keywords by intent (branded, competitor, feature-based)
```

### Google PMax Campaign

```
Set up a Performance Max campaign for my e-commerce store:
- Product: organic dog treats, $24.99 avg order value
- Target ROAS: 400%
- I have product images at these URLs: [paste URLs]
- Write 5 headlines and 3 descriptions
- Use my existing Google Merchant Center feed
```

### Meta Ads Campaign

```
Create a Meta image campaign for my skincare brand:
- Product: anti-aging serum for women 30-55
- Budget: $40/day
- Target interests: skincare, beauty, wellness, anti-aging
- Image URL: [paste URL]
- Write 3 primary text variations and 2 headlines
- Optimize for purchases
```

### LinkedIn Ads Campaign

```
Launch a LinkedIn sponsored content campaign:
- Product: enterprise data analytics platform
- Target: VPs and Directors of Data/Analytics at companies with 500+ employees
- Industries: financial services, healthcare, technology
- Budget: $100/day
- Goal: lead generation with a whitepaper download
- Image URL: [paste URL]
```

### Cross-Platform Audit

```
Audit all my ad accounts for the last 30 days:
- Google: find wasted spend (keywords with clicks but zero conversions)
- Meta: check for creative fatigue (frequency > 3, declining CTR)
- LinkedIn: compare CPA across audience segments

Give me a prioritized action list with estimated monthly savings.
```

## Safety Features

Adspirer's agent skills enforce safety rules to prevent accidental spend:

- **All campaigns created PAUSED:** You review before they go live
- **User confirmation required:** Claude asks before any action that affects spend
- **Read-before-write:** Skills force research and validation before campaign creation
- **Connection status checks:** Always verifies you're managing the right account first
- **No automatic retries:** If a campaign creation fails, Claude won't retry without asking

## Troubleshooting

### "MCP server not found" error

Make sure you ran the add command exactly as written. Check your MCP config:

```bash
cat ~/.config/claude/mcp.json
```

You should see an entry for "adspirer" with the URL `https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp`.

### Authentication keeps failing

Clear your browser cache or try a different browser. The OAuth flow uses PKCE for security -- some browser extensions can interfere. Disable ad blockers temporarily.

### Tools not working after connecting

Check your Adspirer account status at [adspirer.ai](https://adspirer.ai). Free accounts get 10 tool calls/month. If you've hit the limit, upgrade to Plus ($25/mo for 50 calls) or Pro ($75/mo for 100 calls).

### Skills not loading

Verify the skills directory exists:

```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/ad-campaign-management/
```

You should see a SKILL.md file. If not, re-run the copy command from Step 3.

### Claude doesn't seem to follow the workflows

Make sure skills are installed correctly. Also, be specific in your prompts -- instead of "create a campaign," say "create a Google Ads search campaign for [specific product] with [specific budget]." The more context you give, the better Claude follows the workflow.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Do I need to know MCP to use this?">
No. MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the plumbing -- you don't interact with it directly. You just talk to Claude in plain English. The MCP connection happens behind the scenes.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What's the difference between Claude Code and Claude Desktop?">
Claude Code is the terminal-based developer tool. Claude Desktop is the GUI app with chat and Cowork modes. Both support Adspirer through MCP. Use Claude Code if you live in the terminal. Use [Claude Desktop](https://www.adspirer.com/integrations/claude) if you prefer a visual interface.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I manage multiple ad accounts?">
Yes. Adspirer supports multiple accounts per platform. Use the `switch_primary_account` tool to change which account you're managing, or specify the account ID in your prompts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How much does this cost?">
Adspirer pricing is based on tool calls, not ad spend. Free tier: 10 calls/month. Plus: $25/mo for 50 calls. Pro: $75/mo for 100 calls. See the [full pricing breakdown](https://www.adspirer.com/pricing).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is my data safe?">
Yes. Adspirer uses OAuth 2.1 with PKCE -- we never see your passwords. Your ad account credentials live with Google/Meta/LinkedIn/TikTok. We only get read/write permissions you explicitly authorize. You can revoke access anytime from your ad platform's security settings.
