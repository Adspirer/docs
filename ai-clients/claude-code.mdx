## Prerequisites

<Note>
- Claude Code installed:
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```
- An Adspirer account ([free to start](https://adspirer.ai/sign-up))
- At least one ad platform account: Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, or TikTok Ads
- macOS or Linux (Windows requires WSL)
</Note>

## Setup

### Method 1: Plugin Install (Recommended)

The Adspirer plugin installs the MCP server, slash commands, agent, and skills in one step:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add amekala/ads-mcp
/plugin install adspirer
```

Then authenticate:

1. Run `/mcp` in Claude Code
2. Find **plugin:adspirer:adspirer** in the list
3. Click to authenticate — your browser opens for OAuth 2.1 sign-in
4. Sign in, connect your ad platforms, return to Claude Code

Verify it works:

```bash
/adspirer:setup
```

This connects to your accounts, scans your folder for brand docs, pulls live campaign data, and creates a `CLAUDE.md` brand workspace file.

### Method 2: Manual MCP Setup

If you prefer not to use the plugin system, add the MCP server directly:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http adspirer https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp
```

Next time you ask Claude Code about your ad accounts, it'll prompt you to sign in. Your browser opens automatically for OAuth 2.1 authorization.

To add agent skills manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amekala/ads-mcp.git /tmp/ads-mcp
cp -r /tmp/ads-mcp/skills/ad-campaign-management ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Verify Your Setup

Run a test prompt:

```
Check my connected ad platforms
```

You should see a table showing your connected accounts across Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and TikTok Ads — along with account IDs, names, and connection status.

## Brand Workspace

When you run `/adspirer:setup`, the agent bootstraps a brand-specific workspace:

1. **Connects to Adspirer** — verifies your ad platform connections
2. **Scans your folder** — reads any brand docs (`.md`, `.txt`, `.csv`, `.yaml`, `.json`, `.pdf`) for voice, audience, and budget context
3. **Pulls live data** — campaign performance, search terms, benchmarks from all connected platforms
4. **Creates `CLAUDE.md`** — a brand context file with connected platforms, performance snapshot, KPI targets, and brand guidelines

Open your brand folder and run setup:

```bash
cd ~/Clients/YourBrand
claude
```

Then say "set up my brand workspace" or run `/adspirer:setup`.

Your brand folder can contain docs or be completely empty — the agent builds context from your live ad platform data either way. More docs = better brand context = better ad copy and recommendations.

## Slash Commands

The plugin includes 5 slash commands that trigger proven workflows:

| Command | What it Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/adspirer:setup` | Bootstrap a brand workspace — connect accounts, scan docs, pull data, create CLAUDE.md |
| `/adspirer:performance-review` | Cross-platform performance scorecard with KPI comparison |
| `/adspirer:write-ad-copy` | Brand-voice ad copy from real keyword and performance data |
| `/adspirer:wasted-spend` | Find and fix wasted spend across all platforms |
| `/adspirer:refresh-brand-context` | Re-scan docs and update CLAUDE.md with latest data |

You don't need to remember these — just describe what you want and Claude will use the right workflow.

## What You Can Do

100+ tools across 4 ad platforms. Here's what matters:

| Platform | Tools | Key Capabilities |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| **Google Ads** | 39 | Keyword research with real CPC data, Search & PMax campaigns, wasted spend analysis, budget optimization, ad extensions, asset management |
| **LinkedIn Ads** | 28 | Sponsored content, lead gen forms, B2B targeting (job titles, industries, seniority), creative performance analysis |
| **Meta Ads** | 20 | Image/video/carousel campaigns, audience targeting, creative fatigue detection, placement optimization |
| **TikTok Ads** | 4 | In-feed campaigns, asset validation, performance analysis |

Plus 8 automation tools: scheduled briefs, performance monitors, cross-platform reports.

## Example Prompts

What to actually say once you're set up:

</Prompt>

## Safety Features

Adspirer's agent skills enforce safety rules to prevent accidental spend:

- **All campaigns created PAUSED:** You review before they go live
- **User confirmation required:** Claude asks before any action that affects spend
- **Read-before-write:** Skills force research and validation before campaign creation
- **Connection status checks:** Always verifies you're managing the right account first
- **No automatic retries:** If a campaign creation fails, Claude won't retry without asking

## Troubleshooting

### MCP server not found

If you used the plugin, run `/mcp` and look for **plugin:adspirer:adspirer**. Click it to authenticate.

If you used the manual method, check your MCP config:

```bash
cat ~/.config/claude/mcp.json
```

You should see an entry for "adspirer" with the URL `https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp`.

### Authentication keeps failing

Clear your browser cache or try a different browser. The OAuth flow uses PKCE for security — some browser extensions can interfere. Disable ad blockers temporarily.

### Tools not working after connecting

Check your Adspirer account status at [adspirer.ai](https://adspirer.ai). Free accounts get 10 tool calls/month. If you've hit the limit, upgrade to Plus ($25/mo for 50 calls) or Pro ($75/mo for 100 calls).

### Skills not loading

Verify the skills directory exists:

```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/ad-campaign-management/
```

You should see a SKILL.md file. If not, re-run the plugin install or manual copy command.

### Slash commands not available

If `/adspirer:setup` isn't recognized, the plugin may not be installed. Run:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add amekala/ads-mcp
/plugin install adspirer
```

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Do I need to know MCP to use this?">
No. MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the plumbing — you don't interact with it directly. You just talk to Claude in plain English. The MCP connection happens behind the scenes.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What's the difference between Claude Code and Claude Desktop?">
Claude Code is the terminal-based developer tool. Claude Desktop is the GUI app with chat and Cowork modes. Both support Adspirer through MCP. Use Claude Code if you live in the terminal. Use [Claude Desktop](https://www.adspirer.com/integrations/claude) if you prefer a visual interface.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What does the plugin install?">
The Adspirer plugin installs: the MCP server connection, 5 slash commands (setup, performance-review, write-ad-copy, wasted-spend, refresh-brand-context), a performance marketing agent, and the ad campaign management skill file.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I manage multiple ad accounts?">
Yes. Adspirer supports multiple accounts per platform. Use the `switch_primary_account` tool to change which account you're managing, or specify the account ID in your prompts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How much does this cost?">
Adspirer pricing is based on tool calls, not ad spend. Free tier: 10 calls/month. Plus: $25/mo for 50 calls. Pro: $75/mo for 100 calls. See the [full pricing breakdown](https://www.adspirer.com/pricing).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is my data safe?">
Yes. Adspirer uses OAuth 2.1 with PKCE — we never see your passwords. Your ad account credentials live with Google/Meta/LinkedIn/TikTok. We only get read/write permissions you explicitly authorize. You can revoke access anytime from your ad platform's security settings.
