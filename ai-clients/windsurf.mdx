Manage ads from Windsurf without leaving your editor. 100+ tools, same workflow.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
- Windsurf IDE installed ([download here](https://codeium.com/windsurf))
- An Adspirer account ([free to start](https://adspirer.ai/sign-up?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_content=signup))
- At least one ad platform account: Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, or TikTok Ads
- Basic familiarity with JSON config files
</Note>

## Setup (3 Minutes)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Adspirer to Your MCP Config">
    Windsurf stores MCP server configs at `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`. Create or edit that file:

    ```json ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "adspirer": {
          "type": "streamable-http",
          "url": "https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    If you already have other MCP servers configured, add the `"adspirer"` entry to the `"mcpServers"` object. The `"type": "streamable-http"` is important -- it tells Windsurf to use HTTP transport with real-time progress streaming.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart Windsurf">
    MCP configs load on startup. Close Windsurf completely and reopen it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Open Windsurf's AI chat (default hotkey: Cmd+Shift+I or Ctrl+Shift+I) and say:

    ```
    Check my connected ad platforms
    ```

    Windsurf will prompt you to authorize Adspirer. Your browser opens automatically for OAuth 2.1 sign-in. Connect your ad accounts (Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads) and approve permissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the Connection">
    After authenticating, Windsurf should show you a table of your connected accounts with names, IDs, and connection status. If you see your ad platforms listed, you're ready to go.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
You're connected. Windsurf now has access to 100+ advertising tools from the AI chat panel.

## Agent Skills (Coming Soon)

<Note>
**Note:** Windsurf skills support is currently in development.

Skills are instruction files that teach AI assistants the optimal workflow for using Adspirer's 100+ tools -- which tools to call first, how to validate data before creating campaigns, when to ask for user confirmation, etc. Other clients ([Claude Code](/ai-clients/claude-code), [Cursor](/ai-clients/cursor), [OpenClaw](/ai-clients/openclaw)) already have skills available. Windsurf support will be added to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/amekala/ads-mcp) soon.
</Note>

For now, Windsurf has full access to all 100+ Adspirer tools. You just need to be more explicit in your prompts about the workflow you want -- for example, "research keywords before suggesting a campaign" instead of assuming the AI will know to do that automatically.

## Safety Features

- **All campaigns created PAUSED:** Review before they spend money
- **User confirmation prompts:** Windsurf asks before actions that affect spend
- **OAuth 2.1 with PKCE:** No passwords or API keys stored locally
- **Connection verification:** Tools check that you're managing the correct account

## Troubleshooting

### Windsurf doesn't recognize Adspirer tools

Check your MCP config file:

```bash
cat ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json
```

Make sure the JSON is valid (no trailing commas, proper quotes). Verify the `"type"` is set to `"streamable-http"`. Restart Windsurf after any config changes.

### "Connection failed" error

Your firewall or network might be blocking the MCP connection. Try:

- Whitelisting `mcp.adspirer.com` in your firewall
- Checking if your company VPN blocks external HTTP connections
- Testing with a different network to isolate the issue

### OAuth flow not opening in browser

Some browser settings block automatic redirects. Try:

- Manually visiting [adspirer.ai](https://adspirer.ai?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_content=account) and signing in first
- Checking your default browser settings (Windsurf uses your system default)
- Disabling browser extensions that block pop-ups

### Tools returning errors or "limit exceeded"

Check your account status at [adspirer.ai](https://adspirer.ai?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_content=account). Free accounts get 10 tool calls/month. If you've hit the limit, upgrade to Plus ($25/mo for 50 calls) or Pro ($75/mo for 100 calls).

### Config file doesn't exist

If `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` doesn't exist, create the directory structure first:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codeium/windsurf
echo '{"mcpServers":{"adspirer":{"type":"streamable-http","url":"https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp"}}}' > ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json
```
