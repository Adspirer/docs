One plugin, 100+ tools, 14KB skill file built in. No separate setup.

## What Makes OpenClaw Different

Every other MCP client gives you access to Adspirer's 100+ tools. That's the baseline.

OpenClaw gives you a complete AI advertising agent -- pre-configured, pre-trained, ready to run campaigns. The plugin includes a 14.4KB SKILL.md file that documents every tool, every workflow, every platform-specific nuance. The plugin doesn't just connect to Adspirer -- it includes a 14.4KB instruction manual that turns OpenClaw into a specialized advertising AI.

You're deploying an expert, not configuring tools.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
- OpenClaw CLI installed ([download here](https://openclaw.com))
- Node.js 18+ (for npm installation method)
- An Adspirer account ([free to start](https://adspirer.ai/sign-up?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_content=signup))
- At least one ad platform account: Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, or TikTok Ads
</Note>

## Setup (3 Minutes)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Adspirer Plugin">
    ```bash
    openclaw plugins install openclaw-adspirer
    ```

    This installs the plugin with all 100+ tools and the 14.4KB SKILL.md instruction file bundled in. No separate skill or agent installation needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate with Adspirer">
    ```bash
    openclaw adspirer login
    ```

    Your browser opens for OAuth 2.1 sign-in. Authorize OpenClaw to access your Adspirer account. No API keys, no passwords stored locally.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Your Ad Platforms">
    ```bash
    openclaw adspirer connect
    ```

    This opens `adspirer.com` in your browser. Connect Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads — or any combination. Each platform has its own OAuth flow. Authorize the platforms you want to manage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Your Setup">
    ```bash
    openclaw adspirer status
    ```

    You'll see a table showing:

    - Connected platforms (Google, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok)
    - Account names and IDs
    - Connection status (active/expired)
    - Available tool count per platform

    If everything shows "active," you're ready.

## CLI Commands

## What You Get: The Skill File

Most MCP integrations give you raw tool access. OpenClaw gives you a 14,400-character instruction manual that covers:

- **100+ tools documented:** Every parameter, every return value, every edge case
- **6 complete workflows:** Performance analysis, keyword research, campaign creation (per platform), budget optimization, account management, automation
- **Platform quick reference:** When to use each platform, minimum budgets, best use cases
- **Safety rules:** What to always check first, what requires user confirmation, what never to retry
- **Troubleshooting guide:** Common errors and how to fix them
- **Example prompts:** Real queries you can copy-paste to get started

This isn't configuration. It's training. OpenClaw reads the SKILL.md file and knows how to behave like an expert advertising manager.

## What You Can Do

100+ tools across 4 ad platforms:

| Platform | Tools | Key Capabilities |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| **Google Ads** | 39 | Keyword research with real CPC data, Search & PMax campaigns, wasted spend analysis, budget optimization, extensions, asset management |
| **LinkedIn Ads** | 28 | B2B targeting (job titles, industries, seniority), sponsored content, lead gen forms, performance analysis |
| **Meta Ads** | 20 | Image/video/carousel campaigns, audience targeting, creative fatigue detection, placement optimization |
| **TikTok Ads** | 4 | In-feed campaigns, asset validation, performance tracking |

Plus 8 automation tools for scheduling, monitoring, and cross-platform reporting.

| `tiktok_ads` | TikTok Ads | 4 |
| `linkedin_ads` | LinkedIn Ads | 28 |
| `manus` | Automation | 8 |
| `system` | Cross-Platform | 4 |

### Filtering

Enable only specific platforms:

```yaml
config:
  enabledGroups: ["google_ads", "meta_ads"]
```

Or cherry-pick individual tools:

```yaml
config:
  enabledTools: ["echo_test", "get_campaign_performance", "list_campaigns"]
```

## Configuration

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `serverUrl` | string | `https://mcp.adspirer.com` | MCP server URL |
| `accessToken` | string | — | OAuth access token (set by login) |
| `refreshToken` | string | — | OAuth refresh token (set by login) |
| `tokenExpiresAt` | number | — | Token expiry timestamp (set by login) |
| `defaultAccountId` | string | — | Default ad account ID |
| `enabledGroups` | string[] | all groups | Platform groups to enable |
| `enabledTools` | string[] | `[]` | Cherry-pick specific tools (overrides groups) |
| `requestTimeoutMs` | number | `60000` | HTTP request timeout in ms |

## Tool Safety Model

- **Read tools** (`get_*`, `list_*`, `analyze_*`, etc.) — auto-execute, no confirmation needed
- **Write tools** (`create_*`, `update_*`, `pause_*`, etc.) — agent MUST ask user before executing

## The claw.json Manifest

The plugin includes a manifest file that defines its metadata and permissions:

```json
{
  "name": "adspirer-ads-agent",
  "version": "1.2.1",
  "displayName": "Adspirer Ads Agent",
  "keywords": [
    "advertising",
    "google-ads",
    "meta-ads",
    "linkedin-ads",
    "tiktok-ads",
    "ppc",
    "mcp"
  ],
  "permissions": {
    "network": [
      "mcp.adspirer.com",
      "www.adspirer.com"
    ]
  }
}
```

This tells OpenClaw that the plugin is an advertising agent, which keywords to associate with it, and which domains it's allowed to access. The network permissions ensure the plugin can only connect to Adspirer's servers — no other external services.

## Safety Features

The skill file includes safety rules. OpenClaw enforces them automatically:

- **All campaigns created PAUSED:** Review before they spend money
- **User confirmation required:** OpenClaw asks before any action that affects spend
- **Read-before-write workflows:** The agent researches keywords before creating campaigns, validates assets before launching
- **Connection status checks:** Always verifies you're managing the correct account first
- **No automatic retries:** If a tool call fails, OpenClaw reports the error instead of retrying blindly
- **Platform-specific minimums:** The agent knows Google Ads requires $10/day minimum, LinkedIn requires $10/day, Meta has no minimum -- and won't let you create campaigns below those thresholds

## Troubleshooting

### "Plugin not found" error

List your installed plugins:

```bash
openclaw plugins list
```

If you don't see `openclaw-adspirer`, re-run the install command from Step 1.

### "Not authenticated" error

Your login session may have expired. Re-authenticate:

```
openclaw adspirer login
```

### "No ad platforms connected" warning

Run the connect command:

```
openclaw adspirer connect
```

Make sure you authorize at least one ad platform (Google, Meta, LinkedIn, or TikTok) in the OAuth flow.

### Tools not working or returning errors

Check your account status at [adspirer.ai](https://adspirer.ai?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_content=account). Free accounts get 15 tool calls/month. If you've hit the limit, upgrade to Plus ($49/mo for 150 calls) or Pro ($99/mo for 600 calls).

### Skill file not loading

The skill file is bundled with the plugin. If OpenClaw isn't following the documented workflows, try reinstalling:

```bash
openclaw plugins uninstall openclaw-adspirer
openclaw plugins install openclaw-adspirer
```

### Network permission errors

If your firewall blocks the plugin, whitelist these domains:

- `mcp.adspirer.com` (MCP server)
- `www.adspirer.com` (OAuth and account management)

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's the difference between OpenClaw and other MCP clients?">
Other clients ([Claude Code](/ai-clients/claude-code), [Cursor](/ai-clients/cursor)) give you access to Adspirer's tools. OpenClaw gives you a pre-configured advertising agent with a 14KB instruction manual built in. Less setup, more intelligence out of the box.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Do I need to install skills separately?">
No. The SKILL.md file is bundled with the plugin. Other clients require manual skill installation. OpenClaw does it automatically.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I edit the skill file to customize behavior?">
Yes. The skill file is at `node_modules/openclaw-adspirer/skills/adspirer-ads-agent/SKILL.md` (if installed via NPM) or in the OpenClaw plugins directory. Edit it to change default behaviors, add custom workflows, or modify safety rules. Changes take effect on the next OpenClaw restart.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I manage multiple ad accounts?">
Yes. Connect multiple Google Ads accounts, multiple Meta Business Managers, etc. Use the `switch_primary_account` command to change which account you're managing, or specify the account ID in your commands.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How much does this cost?">
Adspirer pricing is based on tool calls, not ad spend. Free tier: 15 calls/month. Plus: $49/mo for 150 calls. Pro: $99/mo for 600 calls. Max: $199/mo for 3,000 calls. See [full pricing details](https://www.adspirer.com/pricing?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_content=pricing).
