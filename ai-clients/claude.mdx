- At least one ad platform account: Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, or TikTok Ads
</Note>

## Setup (2 Minutes)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Claude Connectors">
    Open the Connectors settings directly:

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Custom Connector">
    Click **Add custom connector** (or [open this direct link](https://claude.ai/customize/connectors)) and enter:

    | Field | Value |

    | **URL** | `https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp` |

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Adspirer Skill (Recommended)">

## Why Claude for Advertising

Claude offers unique advantages for ad management:

- **Progress Streaming** — Real-time updates during long operations. See campaign creation progress as it happens (5–30 seconds).
- **Natural Tool Invocation** — Claude understands when to use Ads MCP tools without special syntax. Just describe your goals.
- **Native MCP** — Anthropic created the Model Context Protocol. Claude has the deepest, most reliable integration.
- **Team & Enterprise** — Admins add the connector once for the entire org. Team members authenticate individually.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What are Claude connectors?">
Claude connectors (powered by MCP — Model Context Protocol) allow Claude to securely connect to external services and take actions on your behalf. Anthropic created MCP as an open standard for AI tool integration. Adspirer's connector enables advertising management across Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and TikTok.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Which Claude plans support connectors?">
MCP connectors are available on Claude Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans. The free tier does not include connector functionality. Claude Code (for developers) also supports MCP on paid plans.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What makes Claude different from ChatGPT for ads?">
Claude was created by Anthropic, who also developed MCP. This means the deepest integration, including progress streaming that shows real-time updates during campaign creation. Claude also naturally invokes tools without explicit prompting, while ChatGPT may need you to mention specific tools by name.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I also use Claude Code?">
Yes. Claude Code is the terminal-based developer tool that also supports MCP. See the full [Claude Code Setup Guide](/ai-clients/claude-code) for the one-command setup. Both Claude (chat app) and Claude Code connect to the same Adspirer MCP server.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use Adspirer with both Claude and ChatGPT?">
Yes. Your Adspirer account works across both platforms. Connect the same MCP URL to Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client. Your ad account connections carry across all of them.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How much does this cost?">
Adspirer pricing is based on tool calls, not ad spend. Free tier: 10 calls/month. Plus: $25/mo for 50 calls. Pro: $75/mo for 100 calls. See [full pricing](https://www.adspirer.com/pricing?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_content=pricing).
