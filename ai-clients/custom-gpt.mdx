Use Adspirer directly in ChatGPT. No terminal, no IDE, no MCP configuration. Just open ChatGPT and start managing ad campaigns.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
- ChatGPT Plus, Team, or Enterprise subscription (Custom GPTs require a paid plan)
- An Adspirer account ([free to start](https://adspirer.ai/sign-up?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_content=signup))
- At least one ad platform account: Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, or TikTok Ads
</Note>

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Adspirer GPT">
    Open ChatGPT and search for "Adspirer" in the GPT Store, or use the direct link:

    ```
    https://chatgpt.com/g/adspirer
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start a Conversation">
    Click **Start Chat**. The Adspirer GPT comes pre-configured with instructions for managing ad campaigns across all supported platforms.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Your Ad Accounts">
    On your first interaction, the GPT will prompt you to connect your ad platforms. Say:

    ```
    Connect my ad accounts
    ```

    Your browser opens for OAuth authorization. Sign in to each platform you want to manage (Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads) and approve permissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Your Setup">
    ```
    Check my connected ad platforms
    ```

    You should see a table showing your connected accounts, account names, IDs, and active status.

## How It Works

The Adspirer Custom GPT uses OpenAI's Actions feature to connect to Adspirer's API. Under the hood:

1. You type a natural language request ("Create a Google Search campaign for...")
2. The GPT translates your request into Adspirer tool calls
3. Adspirer executes the action via ad platform APIs (Google, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok)
4. Results come back in the chat — formatted tables, recommendations, confirmations

No MCP setup. No terminal commands. No configuration files. It just works inside ChatGPT.

## What You Can Do

100+ tools across 4 ad platforms:

| Platform | Tools | Key Capabilities |
|----------|-------|--------------------|
| **Google Ads** | 39 | Keyword research with real CPC data, Search & PMax campaigns, wasted spend analysis, budget optimization |
| **Meta Ads** | 20 | Image/video/carousel campaigns, audience targeting, creative fatigue detection, placement optimization |
| **LinkedIn Ads** | 28 | B2B targeting (job titles, industries, seniority), sponsored content, lead gen forms |
| **TikTok Ads** | 4 | In-feed campaigns, asset validation, performance tracking |

## Example Prompts

### Google Search Campaign

<Prompt description="Google Search campaign for consulting with negative keywords." actions={["copy", "cursor"]}>
Create a Google Ads search campaign for my consulting firm:
- Service: fractional CFO services for startups
- Target: startup founders and CEOs at Series A-B companies
- Budget: $60/day
- Research keywords with real CPC data first
- Add negative keywords for 'jobs', 'salary', 'free'
</Prompt>

### Meta Ads Campaign

<Prompt description="Meta image campaign with audience targeting and purchase optimization." actions={["copy", "cursor"]}>
Create a Meta image campaign for my skincare brand:
- Product: anti-aging serum for women 30-55
- Budget: $40/day
- Target interests: skincare, beauty, wellness, anti-aging
- Image URL: [paste URL]
- Optimize for purchases
</Prompt>

### Cross-Platform Performance Report

<Prompt description="Multi-platform performance report highlighting underperformers." actions={["copy", "cursor"]}>
Pull my ad performance for the last 30 days across all platforms.
Show spend, conversions, CPA, and ROAS for each.
Highlight anything underperforming.
</Prompt>

### Budget Optimization

<Prompt description="Wasted spend analysis for zero-conversion keywords." actions={["copy", "cursor"]}>

</Prompt>

## Custom GPT vs MCP Clients

| Feature | Custom GPT | MCP Clients (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) |
|---------|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| **Setup** | Click and go | Terminal command |
| **Interface** | ChatGPT web/mobile | IDE or terminal |
| **Agent Skills** | Built into GPT instructions | Install separately |
| **Best for** | Marketers, non-technical users | Developers, power users |
| **Offline** | No | No |
| **Cost** | ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo) + Adspirer | AI client subscription + Adspirer |

<Tip>
If you're a developer or live in the terminal, use [Claude Code](/ai-clients/claude-code) or [Cursor](/ai-clients/cursor) instead. If you're a marketer who uses ChatGPT daily, the Custom GPT is the fastest path.
</Tip>

## Safety Features

The Adspirer GPT enforces the same safety rules as all other clients:

- **All campaigns created PAUSED** — you review before they go live
- **Confirmation before spend** — the GPT asks before any budget-affecting action
- **Research-first workflows** — keyword research and asset validation happen before campaign creation
- **Connection checks** — always verifies you're managing the correct account first

## Troubleshooting

### "Adspirer GPT not found" in GPT Store

The GPT may not appear in all regions. Try the direct link above. If still unavailable, use one of our [MCP-based AI clients](/ai-clients/claude-code) instead.

### Authentication keeps failing

Clear your browser cache or try an incognito window. The OAuth flow uses secure tokens — browser extensions (especially ad blockers) can interfere.

### "Action failed" errors

Check your Adspirer account status at [adspirer.ai](https://adspirer.ai?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_content=account). Free accounts get 10 tool calls/month. If you've hit the limit, upgrade to Plus ($25/mo for 50 calls) or Pro ($75/mo for 100 calls).

### GPT not following workflows correctly

Be specific in your prompts. Instead of "create a campaign," say "create a Google Ads search campaign for [product] with [budget] targeting [audience]." The more context you give, the better the GPT follows the correct workflow.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Do I need ChatGPT Plus?">
Yes. Custom GPTs require ChatGPT Plus ($20/month), Team, or Enterprise. Free ChatGPT users can't access custom GPTs. If you don't have Plus, use [Claude Code](/ai-clients/claude-code) or [Cursor](/ai-clients/cursor) instead.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use this on mobile?">
Yes. The Adspirer GPT works in the ChatGPT mobile app (iOS and Android). Same features, same tools.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is this the same as using MCP with Claude?">
Similar capabilities, different interface. The Custom GPT uses OpenAI Actions (API calls). MCP clients use Model Context Protocol. Both connect to Adspirer's 100+ tools. The Custom GPT is simpler to set up; MCP clients offer more flexibility and agent skills.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How much does Adspirer cost?">
Adspirer pricing is based on tool calls, not ad spend. Free tier: 10 calls/month. Plus: $25/mo for 50 calls. Pro: $75/mo for 100 calls. See [full pricing](https://www.adspirer.com/pricing?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_content=pricing).
