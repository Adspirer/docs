Manage ads from your code editor. One command to install, 100+ tools, automatic workflow rules, zero context-switching.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
- [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.com/) installed (v2.4+ recommended for subagent support)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed (used by the installer)
- An Adspirer account ([free to start](https://adspirer.ai/sign-up?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_content=signup))
- At least one ad platform account: Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, or TikTok Ads
</Note>

## Setup

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Quick Install (Recommended)">
**Run this from your system terminal** (Terminal.app, iTerm, Windows Terminal, etc.), **not** Cursor's built-in terminal.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the Installer">
    ```bash
    bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amekala/ads-mcp/main/plugins/cursor/adspirer/install.sh)
    ```

    This installs the performance marketing subagent, all 5 skills, and the MCP server config automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart Cursor">
    Close and reopen Cursor to load the new MCP config.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate with Adspirer">
    Open **Cursor Settings > MCP**. You should see `adspirer` listed. Click on it to authenticate — a browser window will open for Adspirer login.

    If `adspirer` is missing, add it manually: **Cursor Settings > MCP > Add Server** with URL:

    ```
    https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Your Brand Workspace">
    Open your brand folder and switch to **Agent mode** (not Ask or Edit mode):

    ```bash
    cd ~/Clients/YourBrand
    cursor .
    ```

    Then say:

    ```
    set up my brand workspace
    ```

    The agent will connect to your ad accounts, scan for brand docs, pull live campaign data, and create `BRAND.md`. If it doesn't trigger automatically, type: `/adspirer-setup`

<Tab title="Manual Setup">
<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the Repo">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amekala/ads-mcp.git /tmp/ads-mcp
    cd /tmp/ads-mcp/plugins/cursor/adspirer
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Subagent and Skills">
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.cursor/agents ~/.cursor/skills
    cp .cursor/agents/performance-marketing-agent.md ~/.cursor/agents/
    cp -r .cursor/skills/adspirer-ads ~/.cursor/skills/
    cp -r .cursor/skills/adspirer-setup ~/.cursor/skills/
    cp -r .cursor/skills/adspirer-performance-review ~/.cursor/skills/
    cp -r .cursor/skills/adspirer-write-ad-copy ~/.cursor/skills/
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the MCP Server">
    Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "adspirer": {
          "url": "https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Or use **Cursor Settings > MCP > Add Server** with URL `https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Rules (Optional)">
    ```bash
    cd ~/Clients/YourBrand
    mkdir -p .cursor/rules
    cp /tmp/ads-mcp/plugins/cursor/adspirer/.cursor/rules/*.mdc .cursor/rules/
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart and Authenticate">
    Restart Cursor. Open **Cursor Settings > MCP**, find `adspirer`, and click to authenticate via browser.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Your Brand Workspace">
    Open your brand folder, switch to **Agent mode**, and say:

    ```
    set up my brand workspace
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
</Tab>

## How Cursor Rules Improve Your Workflow

If you installed the Cursor Rule (included in both the one-command installer and manual install), here's what changes:

### Before Rules:

**You:** "Create a Google Ads campaign for running shoes"

**Cursor:** Immediately calls `create_search_campaign` with generic parameters — fails because no keyword research, no asset validation.

### After Rules:

**You:** "Create a Google Ads campaign for running shoes"

**Cursor:** Automatically follows the workflow:

1. Calls `get_connections_status` (verify you're managing the right account)
2. Calls `research_keywords` with "running shoes" seed keywords
3. Shows you CPC data and keyword suggestions
4. Calls `discover_existing_assets` (check if you have images/headlines already)
5. Calls `validate_and_prepare_assets` (make sure assets meet Google's requirements)
6. Calls `create_search_campaign` with validated data
7. **Asks for your confirmation** before actually creating the campaign

Rules turn one vague prompt into a complete, validated workflow. You still control the final decision — nothing launches without your approval.

## Safety Features

- **All campaigns created PAUSED:** Review before they spend money
- **User confirmation required:** Cursor asks before any write action
- **Read-before-write enforcement:** Skills prevent campaign creation without research
- **Connection checks:** Always verifies you're managing the correct account first
- **No automatic retries:** If something fails, Cursor waits for your input instead of retrying blindly

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Install fails with permission/hooks error | Run the install from your **system terminal**, not Cursor's built-in terminal (it's sandboxed) |
| MCP server not showing | Open Cursor Settings > MCP > Add server with URL `https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp` |
| MCP connection error | Click the server in Settings > MCP to re-authenticate via browser |
| Authentication failed | Remove and re-add the MCP server in Cursor Settings |
| OAuth window doesn't open | Check browser pop-up blocker. Try restarting Cursor. |
| No ad platforms connected | Connect platforms at [adspirer.com](https://www.adspirer.com) |
| Skills not showing | Verify: `ls ~/.cursor/skills/` — should show `adspirer-*` directories |
| Subagent not triggering | Ensure you're in **Agent mode** (not Ask or Edit). Try `/adspirer-setup` directly. |
| No data returned | Check for active campaigns. Try longer lookback (60/90 days) |
| Rate limit hit | Check Adspirer tier (Free: 10/mo, Plus: 50, Pro: 100, Enterprise: unlimited) |

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's the difference between global and per-project config?">
**Global (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):** Adspirer works in every Cursor project. Use this if you manage ads regularly.

**Per-project (`.cursor/mcp.json`):** Adspirer only works in that specific project. Use this if you're working on a client's codebase and want ad management tools only for that client.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use Adspirer with Cursor Composer?">
Yes. Cursor Composer (multi-file editing mode) has full access to Adspirer tools. You can ask Composer to analyze campaigns, generate reports, and save the output as markdown files in your project — all in one flow.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Do I need both Skills and Cursor Rules?">
No, but they complement each other. Skills teach Cursor *how* to use the tools. Cursor Rules enforce *when* and *why* to use them. The one-command installer includes both.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How much does Adspirer cost?">
Pricing is based on tool calls, not ad spend. Free tier: 10 calls/month. Plus: $25/mo for 50 calls. Pro: $75/mo for 100 calls. See [full pricing details](https://www.adspirer.com/pricing?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_content=pricing).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I manage multiple ad accounts?">
Yes. Connect multiple Google Ads accounts, multiple Meta Business Managers, etc. Use the `switch_primary_account` tool to change which account you're managing, or specify the account ID in your prompts.
