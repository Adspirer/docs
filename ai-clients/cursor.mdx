description: "Connect Cursor IDE to Adspirer MCP. Manage Google, Meta, LinkedIn, and TikTok Ads from your editor with 100+ tools, 5 skills, and a performance marketing subagent."
---

Manage ads from your code editor. One command to install, 100+ tools, automatic workflow rules, zero context-switching.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
- [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.com/) installed (v2.4+ recommended for subagent support)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed (used by the installer)
- An Adspirer account ([free to start](https://adspirer.ai/sign-up?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_content=signup))
- At least one ad platform account: Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, or TikTok Ads
</Note>

## Quick Install (One Command)

**Run this from your system terminal** (Terminal.app, iTerm, Windows Terminal, etc.), **not** Cursor's built-in terminal. Cursor's terminal is sandboxed and can't write to `~/.cursor/`, which causes permission errors.

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amekala/ads-mcp/main/plugins/cursor/adspirer/install.sh)
```

This automatically:
- Installs the performance marketing subagent to `~/.cursor/agents/`
- Installs all 5 Adspirer skills to `~/.cursor/skills/`
- Configures the Adspirer MCP server in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

Then restart Cursor.

<Note>
The installer does not require authentication. You'll authenticate in the Getting Started steps below.
</Note>

## Getting Started

### 1. Verify the MCP server is connected

Open **Cursor Settings > MCP**. You should see `adspirer` listed.

If it shows a connection error, click on it to authenticate. A browser window will open for Adspirer login — complete the sign-in and return to Cursor.

If `adspirer` is missing entirely, add it manually: **Cursor Settings > MCP > Add Server** with URL: `https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp`

### 2. Open your brand folder in Cursor

```bash
cd ~/Clients/YourBrand
cursor .
```

Your brand folder can have docs (`.md`, `.txt`, `.csv`, `.yaml`, `.json`, `.pdf`) or be completely empty.

### 3. Switch to Agent mode and say "set up my brand workspace"

Make sure you're in **Agent mode** (not Ask or Edit mode) in the Cursor chat panel.

The agent will:
1. Connect to your ad accounts (may open a browser for OAuth on first use)
2. Scan the folder for brand docs
3. Pull live campaign data from all connected platforms
4. Create `BRAND.md` with your brand context, performance snapshot, and KPI targets
5. Tell you what it found and ask what you'd like to work on

If it doesn't trigger automatically, type: `/adspirer-setup`

### 4. Start managing campaigns

<Prompt description="Check campaign status across all connected platforms." actions={["copy", "cursor"]}>
How are my Google Ads campaigns doing?
</Prompt>

<Prompt description="Find wasted ad spend across all platforms." actions={["copy", "cursor"]}>
Find wasted spend across all platforms
</Prompt>

<Prompt description="Write new ad headlines from real performance data." actions={["copy", "cursor"]}>
Write new headlines for my Google Search campaigns
</Prompt>

## Manual Install (Alternative)

If you prefer to install manually instead of using the one-command script:

<Expandable title="Click to expand manual steps">

### Step 1: Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amekala/ads-mcp.git /tmp/ads-mcp
cd /tmp/ads-mcp/plugins/cursor/adspirer
```

### Step 2: Install subagent and skills

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/agents ~/.cursor/skills
cp .cursor/agents/performance-marketing-agent.md ~/.cursor/agents/
cp -r .cursor/skills/adspirer-ads ~/.cursor/skills/
cp -r .cursor/skills/adspirer-setup ~/.cursor/skills/
cp -r .cursor/skills/adspirer-performance-review ~/.cursor/skills/
cp -r .cursor/skills/adspirer-write-ad-copy ~/.cursor/skills/
cp -r .cursor/skills/adspirer-wasted-spend ~/.cursor/skills/
```

### Step 3: Add the MCP server

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "adspirer": {
      "url": "https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Or use **Cursor Settings > MCP > Add Server** with URL `https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp`.

### Step 4: Copy rules to your brand folder (optional)

```bash
cd ~/Clients/YourBrand
mkdir -p .cursor/rules
cp /tmp/ads-mcp/plugins/cursor/adspirer/.cursor/rules/*.mdc .cursor/rules/
```

### Step 5: Restart Cursor

## How Cursor Rules Improve Your Workflow

If you installed the Cursor Rule (included in both the one-command installer and manual install), here's what changes:

### Before Rules:

**You:** "Create a Google Ads campaign for running shoes"

**Cursor:** Immediately calls `create_search_campaign` with generic parameters — fails because no keyword research, no asset validation.

### After Rules:

**You:** "Create a Google Ads campaign for running shoes"

**Cursor:** Automatically follows the workflow:

1. Calls `get_connections_status` (verify you're managing the right account)
2. Calls `research_keywords` with "running shoes" seed keywords
3. Shows you CPC data and keyword suggestions
4. Calls `discover_existing_assets` (check if you have images/headlines already)
5. Calls `validate_and_prepare_assets` (make sure assets meet Google's requirements)
6. Calls `create_search_campaign` with validated data
7. **Asks for your confirmation** before actually creating the campaign

Rules turn one vague prompt into a complete, validated workflow. You still control the final decision — nothing launches without your approval.

## Safety Features

- **All campaigns created PAUSED:** Review before they spend money
- **User confirmation required:** Cursor asks before any write action
- **Read-before-write enforcement:** Skills prevent campaign creation without research
- **Connection checks:** Always verifies you're managing the correct account first
- **No automatic retries:** If something fails, Cursor waits for your input instead of retrying blindly

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Install fails with permission/hooks error | Run the install from your **system terminal**, not Cursor's built-in terminal (it's sandboxed) |
| MCP server not showing | Open Cursor Settings > MCP > Add server with URL `https://mcp.adspirer.com/mcp` |
| MCP connection error | Click the server in Settings > MCP to re-authenticate via browser |
| Authentication failed | Remove and re-add the MCP server in Cursor Settings |
| OAuth window doesn't open | Check browser pop-up blocker. Try restarting Cursor. |
| No ad platforms connected | Connect platforms at [adspirer.com](https://www.adspirer.com) |
| Skills not showing | Verify: `ls ~/.cursor/skills/` — should show `adspirer-*` directories |
| Subagent not triggering | Ensure you're in **Agent mode** (not Ask or Edit). Try `/adspirer-setup` directly. |
| No data returned | Check for active campaigns. Try longer lookback (60/90 days) |
| Rate limit hit | Check Adspirer tier (Free: 10/mo, Plus: 50, Pro: 100, Enterprise: unlimited) |

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What's the difference between global and per-project config?">
**Global (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):** Adspirer works in every Cursor project. Use this if you manage ads regularly.

**Per-project (`.cursor/mcp.json`):** Adspirer only works in that specific project. Use this if you're working on a client's codebase and want ad management tools only for that client.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use Adspirer with Cursor Composer?">
Yes. Cursor Composer (multi-file editing mode) has full access to Adspirer tools. You can ask Composer to analyze campaigns, generate reports, and save the output as markdown files in your project — all in one flow.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Do I need both Skills and Cursor Rules?">
No, but they complement each other. Skills teach Cursor *how* to use the tools. Cursor Rules enforce *when* and *why* to use them. The one-command installer includes both.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How much does Adspirer cost?">
Pricing is based on tool calls, not ad spend. Free tier: 10 calls/month. Plus: $25/mo for 50 calls. Pro: $75/mo for 100 calls. See [full pricing details](https://www.adspirer.com/pricing?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_content=pricing).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I manage multiple ad accounts?">
Yes. Connect multiple Google Ads accounts, multiple Meta Business Managers, etc. Use the `switch_primary_account` tool to change which account you're managing, or specify the account ID in your prompts.
</Accordion>
